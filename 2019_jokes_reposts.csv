82092,There was a man who drove trains for a living.,"he loved his job. driving a train had been his dream ever since he was a child. he loved to make the train go as fast as possible. unfortunately, one day he was a little too reckless and caused a crash. he made it out, but a single person died. well, needless to say, he went to court over this incident. he was found guilty, and was sentenced to death by electrocution. when the day of the execution came, he requested a single banana as his last meal. after eating the banana, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was flown, sparks flew, and smoke filled the air - but nothing happened. the man was perfectly fine.
 
well, at the time, there was an old bulgarian law that said a failed execution was a sign of divine intervention, so the man was allowed to go free. somehow, he managed to get his old job back driving the train. having not learned his lesson at all, he went right back to driving the train with reckless abandon. once again, he caused a train to crash, this time killing two people. the trial went much the same as the first, resulting in a sentence of execution. for his final meal, the man requested two bananas. after eating the bananas, he was strapped into the electric chair. the switch was thrown, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was once again unharmed.
 
well, this of course meant that he was free to go. and once again, he somehow managed to get his old job back. to what should have been the surprise of no one, he crashed yet another train and killed three people. and so he once again found himself being sentenced to death. on the day of his execution, he requested his final meal: three bananas.
 
""you know what? no,"" said the executioner. ""i've had it with you and your stupid bananas and walking out of here unharmed. i'm not giving you a thing to eat; we're strapping you in and doing this now."" well, it was against protocol, but the man was strapped in to the electric chair without a last meal. the switch was pulled, sparks flew, smoke filled the room - and the man was still unharmed. the executioner was speechless.

the man looked at the executioner and said, ""oh, the bananas had nothing to do with it. i'm just a bad conductor.""",25,523,27,1566779239.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cvgnxu/there_was_a_man_who_drove_trains_for_a_living/

25589,"One day, Albert Einstein had to speak at an important science conference.","on the way there, he tells his driver that looks a bit like him:
 

""i'm sick of all these conferences. i always say the same things over and over!""


the driver agrees: ""you're right. as your driver, i attended all of them, and even though i don't know anything about science, i could give the conference in your place.""
 

""that's a great idea!"" says einstein. ""let's switch places then!""
 

so they switch clothes and as soon as they arrive, the driver dressed as einstein goes on stage and starts giving the usual speech, while the real einstein, dressed as the car driver, attends it.
 

but in the crowd, there is one scientist who wants to impress everyone and thinks of a very difficult question to ask einstein, hoping he won't be able to respond. so this guy stands up and interrupts the conference by posing his very difficult question. the whole room goes silent, holding their breath, waiting for the response.
 

the driver looks at him, dead in the eye, and says :


 ""sir, your question is so easy to answer that i'm going to let my driver reply to it for me.""

the next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “we can’t tell you. you’re not a monk.”

the man is disappointed but thanks them anyway and goes about his merry way.

some years later, the same man breaks down in front of the same monastery.

the monks accept him, feed him, even fix his car. that night, he hears the same strange noise that he had heard years earlier.

the man says, “all right, all right. i’m dying to know. if the only way i can find out what that sound was is to become a monk, how do i become a monk?”

the monks reply, “you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of sand pebbles. when you find these numbers, you will become a monk.”

the man sets about his task. forty-five years later, he returns and knocks on the door of the monastery. he says, “i have traveled the earth and have found what you have asked for. there are 145,236,284,232 blades of grass and 231,281,219,999,129,382 sand pebbles on the earth.”

22436,Dave was bragging to his boss one day," ""you know, i know everyone there is to know. just name someone, anyone, and i know them.""

tired of his boasting, his boss called his bluff, ""ok, dave, how about tom cruise?""

""no dramas boss, tom and i are old friends, and i can prove it."" so dave and his boss fly out to hollywood and knock on tom cruise's door, and tom cruise shouts,

""dave! what's happening? great to see you! come on in for a beer!""

although impressed, dave's boss is still skeptical. after they leave cruise's house, he tells dave that he thinks him knowing cruise was just lucky.

""no, no, just name anyone else,"" dave says.

""president trump,"" his boss quickly retorts.

""yup,"" dave says, ""old buddies, let's fly out to washington,"" and off they go.

at the white house, trump spots dave on the tour and motions him and his boss over, saying, ""dave, what a surprise, i was just on my way to a meeting, but you and your friend come on in and let's have a beer first and catch up.""

well, the boss is very shaken by now but still not totally convinced. after they leave the white house grounds he expresses his doubts to dave, who again implores him to name anyone else.

""pope francis,"" his boss replies.

""sure!"" says dave. ""i've known the pope for years."" so off they fly to rome.

dave and his boss are assembled with the masses at the vatican's st. peter's square when dave says, ""this will never work. i can't catch the pope's eye among all these people. tell you what, i know all the guards so let me just go upstairs and i'll come out on the balcony with the pope."" he disappears into the crowd headed towards the vatican.

sure enough, half an hour later dave emerges with the pope on the balcony, but by the time dave returns, he finds that his boss has had a heart attack and is surrounded by paramedics.

making his way to his boss' side, dave asks him, ""what happened?""

his boss looks up and says, ""it was the final straw... you and the pope came out onto the balcony and the man next to me said, 'who the fuck is that on the balcony with dave?'",10,661,37,1552085605.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/aywj46/dave_was_bragging_to_his_boss_one_day/

struggling to maintain his composure, he calmly asked, “what’s your business at this convention?”
“lecturer,” she responded. “i use information that i have learned from my personal experiences to debunk some of the popular myths about sexuality.”
“really?” he said. “and what kind of myths are there?”
“well,” she explained, “one popular myth is that african-american men are the most well-endowed of all men, when in fact it is the native american indian who is most likely to possess that trait. another popular myth is that frenchmen are the best lovers, when actually it is men of mexican descent who are the best. i have also discovered that the lover with absolutely the best stamina is the southern redneck.”

suddenly the woman became a little uncomfortable and blushed.. “i’m sorry,” she said, “i shouldn't really be discussing all of this with you. i don’t even know your name.”

386,A mailman notices a mailbox with the flag up,"so, he opens the box and picks up the letter.  he glances at it briefly to make sure it is stamped, and then puts it in his bag with his other letters.  when he gets back to his office, the letter goes in a big bin with all of the other out-going mail.  he thinks nothing of it, and finishes his day.

a few days later, he delivers the exact same letter to the same house that he picked it up from.  he glances at the mailing address and observes that it is indeed the same as the return address.  anyone can make a mistake, so the mailman puts the letter in the mailbox so that the customer can readdress it for its proper recipient.  he thinks nothing of it and finishes his day.

the next day, the mailman sees the same mailbox with the flag up.  he opens the box and again sees the same letter, nothing changed, but with a new stamp on it.  the mailman is perplexed, and thinking to save the customer both time and money, decides to ring the doorbell and inquire about the letter.

*ding-dong, ding-dong.  ding-dong, ding-dong.  ding-dong, ding-dong.*

the door opens and standing there is a stout buddhist monk, dressed in traditional garb.

“pardon me, sir,” the mailman says, “but you seem to be trying to mail this letter again, and without any changes to the address, it’s only going to end up back at your home in a few days.”

“ah, my letter.  thank you so much for mailing it the other day, it was greatly appreciated.  please do so again” replies the buddhist monk.

“but sir,” says mailman, “you will only waste a stamp, and this letter will be re-delivered to your home a few days from now.”

“but that is my intention, dear man,” replies the buddhist monk.  “you see, reposting is the best way to get karma.”

15353,"Several centuries ago, the Pope decreed that all the Jews had to convert to Catholicism or leave Italy. There was a huge outcry from the Jewish community, so the Pope offered a deal. He'd have a religious debate with the leader of the Jewish community...","if the jews won, they could stay in italy; if the pope won, they'd have to convert or leave.

the jewish people met and picked an aged and wise rabbi to represent them in the debate.

however, as the rabbi spoke no italian, and the pope spoke no hebrew, they agreed that it would be a 'silent' debate.

on the chosen day, the pope and the rabbi sat opposite each other

the pope raised his hand and showed three fingers.

the rabbi looked back and raised one finger.

next, the pope waved his finger around his head. the rabbi pointed to the ground where he sat.

the pope brought out a communion wafer and a chalice of wine.

the rabbi pulled out an apple.

with that, the pope stood up and declared himself beaten and said that the rabbi was too clever. the jews could stay in italy!

later the cardinals met with the pope and asked him what had happened. the pope said, 'first i held up three fingers to represent the trinity. he responded by holding up a single finger to remind me there is still only one god common to both our beliefs.' 'then, i waved my finger around my head to show him that god was all around us. he responded by pointing to the ground to show that god was also right here with us.' 'finally, i pulled out the wine and wafer to show that god absolves us of all our sins. he pulled out an apple to remind me of the original sin.' 'he bested me at every move and i could not continue!'

meanwhile, the jewish community gathered to ask the rabbi how he had won. 'i don't have a clue!!!' the rabbi said. 'first, he told me that we had three days to get out of italy, so i gave him the finger.' then he tells me that the whole country would be cleared of jews, so i told him that we were staying right here.

Before leaving, she says to the clerk, ‘I hope you don’t mind my asking, but how old do you think I am?”.","’about 32,’ is the reply.’

‘nope! i’m exactly 50,’ the woman says happily.

a little while later she goes into mcdonald’s and asks the counter girl the very same question.

the girl replies, ‘i’d guess about 29.’ the woman replies with a big smile, ‘nope, i’m 50.’

now she’s feeling really good about herself. she stops at a candy shop on her way down the street.

she goes up to the counter to get some mints and asks the assistant the same burning question.

the clerk responds, ‘oh, i’d say 30.’

again she proudly responds, ‘i’m 50, but thank you!’

while waiting for the bus to go home, she asks an old man waiting next to her the same question.

he replies, ‘lady, i’m 78 and my eyesight is going. although, when i was young there was a sure-fire way to tell how old a woman was. it sounds very forward, but it requires you to let me put my hands under your bra then, and only then i can tell you exactly how old you are.’

they wait in silence on the empty street until her curiosity gets the better of her. she finally blurts out, ‘what the hell, go ahead.’

he slips both of his hands under her blouse and begins to feel around very slowly and carefully. he bounces and weighs each breast and he gently pinches each nipple. he pushes her breasts together and rubs them against each other.

after a couple of minutes of this, she says, ‘okay, okay.....how old am i?’

he completes one last squeeze of her breasts, removes his hands, and says, ‘madam, you are 50.’

stunned and amazed, the woman says, ‘that was incredible, how could you tell?’

23524,Your DUCK IS DEAD,"a woman brought a very limp duck into a veterinary surgeon. as she laid her pet on the table, the vet pulled out his stethoscope and listened to the bird's chest.

after a moment or two, the vet shook his head and sadly said, ""i'm sorry, your duck, cuddles, has passed away.""

the distressed woman wailed, ""are you sure?""

""yes, i am sure. your duck is dead,"" replied the vet..

""how can you be so sure?"" she protested.. ""i mean you haven't done any testing on him or anything. he might just be in a coma or something.""

the vet rolled his eyes, turned around and left the room. he returned a few minutes later with a black labrador retriever. as the duck's owner looked on in amazement, the dog stood on his hind legs, put his front paws on the examination table and sniffed the duck from top to bottom. he then looked up at the vet with sad eyes and shook his head.

the vet patted the dog on the head and took it out of the room. a few minutes later he returned with a cat. the cat jumped on the table and also delicately sniffed the bird from head to foot. the cat sat back on its haunches, shook its head, meowed softly and strolled out of the room.

the vet looked at the woman and said, ""i'm sorry, but as i said, this is most definitely, 100% certifiably, a dead duck.""

the vet turned to his computer terminal, hit a few keys and produced a bill, which he handed to the woman..

the duck's owner, still in shock, took the bill. ""$1,500!"" she cried,""$1,500 just to tell me my duck is dead!""

the vet shrugged, ""i'm sorry. if you had just taken my word for it, the bill would have been $20, but with the lab report and the cat scan, it's now $1,500.""",7,19153,237,1552322899.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/azvnq7/your_duck_is_dead/

first - you have to drink a whole quart of tequila, in 60 seconds or less,
and you can't make a face while doing it.""

every weekend we take the chicken eggs and put them in the incubator.

""my aunt tammie fought in the gulf war, and her plane was shot down over enemy territory. 

she jumped out before it crashed but could only take a case of beer, a submachine gun and a bowie knife. 

on the way down, she drank the case of beer. 

then she landed right in the middle of 100 iraqi soldiers. 

she shot 70 with her submachine gun, but then she ran out of bullets! 

so she pulled out her bowie knife and killed 20 more. 

then the blade on her bowie knife broke, so she killed the last ten with her bare hands.""

the teacher looked a little shocked. 

after clearing her throat, she asked what possible moral there could be to this story.

Naturally, she was very upset.","“you are a disrespectful pig!” she cried. “how dare you do this to me! i’m a faithful wife, the mother of your children! i’m leaving you. i want a divorce right away!”

the husband replied, “hang on just a minute love, so at least i can tell you what happened.”

“go ahead,” she sobbed, “but they’ll be the last words you’ll say to me!”

so the husband began, “well, i was getting into the car to drive home, and this young lady here asked me for a lift. she looked so down and out and defenseless that i took pity on her and let her into the car.

i noticed that she was very thin, not well dressed and very dirty. she told me that she hadn’t eaten for three days. so, in my compassion, i brought her home and warmed up the enchiladas i made for you last night. the ones you wouldn’t eat because you’re afraid you’ll put on weight. the poor thing devoured them in moments!

since she needed a good clean-up, i suggested a shower, and while she was doing that, i noticed her clothes were dirty and full of holes so i threw them away. then, as she needed clothes, i gave her the designer jeans that you have had for a few years, but don’t wear because you say they are too tight.

i also gave her the underwear that was your anniversary present, which you don’t wear because i don’t have good taste. i found the sexy blouse my sister gave you for christmas that you don’t wear just to annoy her and i also donated those boots you bought at the expensive boutique and don’t wear because someone at work has a pair the same.”

the husband took a quick breath and continued, “she was so grateful for my understanding and help that as i walked her to the door, she turned to me with tears in her eyes and said…” “do you have anything else that your wife doesn’t use?”",6,38766,924,1574512240.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/e0h9tp/one_day_a_wife_came_home_early_and_found_her/

""oh jim, you old devil, that sounds like a crazy, but good idea!""

a police officer sitting in the next booth heard their conversation and, having a chuckle to himself, he thinks to himself, i've got to see these two old-timers having sex against a fence. i'll just keep an eye on them so there's no trouble. so he follows them.

the elderly couple walks haltingly along, leaning on each other for support aided by walking sticks. finally, they get to the back of the tavern and make their way to the fence the old lady lifts her skirt and the old man drops his trousers. as she leans against the fence, the old man moves in..

then suddenly they erupt into the most furious sex that the policeman has ever seen. this goes on for about ten minutes while both are making loud noises and moaning and screaming. finally, they both collapse, panting on the ground.

the policeman is amazed. he thinks he has learned something about life and old age that he didn't know.

after about half an hour of lying on the ground recovering, the old couple struggles to their feet and put their clothes back on.

the policeman, is still watching and thinks to himself, this is truly amazing, i've got to ask them what their secret is.

so, as the couple passes, he says to them, ""excuse me, but that was something else. you must've had a fantastic sex life together. is there some sort of secret to this?""

dear, dad. it is with great regret and sorrow that i'm writing you. i had to elope with my new girlfriend, because i wanted to avoid a scene with mum and you.  


i've been finding real passion with stacy. she is so nice, but i knew you would not approve of her because of all her piercing's, tattoos, her tight motorcycle clothes, and because she is so much older than i am.  


but it's not only the passion, dad. she's pregnant. stacy said that we will be very happy. she owns a trailer in the woods, and has a stack of firewood for the whole winter. we share a dream of having many more children.  


stacy has opened my eyes to the fact that marijuana doesn't really hurt anyone. we'll be growing it for ourselves and trading it with the other people in the commune for all the cocaine and ecstasy we want.  


in the meantime, we'll pray that science will find a cure for aids so that stacy can get better. she sure deserves it!  


don't worry dad, i'm 15, and i know how to take care of myself. someday, i'm sure we'll be back to visit so you can get to know your many grandchildren.

the agency then hired an ornithological behaviourist to determine if there was a cause for the disproportionate percentages of motorbike kills versus car kills. the ornithological behaviourist quickly concluded that when crows eat road kill, they always have a look-out crow to warn of danger. they discovered that while all the lookout crows could shout ""cah"", not a single one could shout ""bike""",5,320,16,1556910489.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bkc7h2/crows_arent_so_smart_after_all/

so, when her first child was born, she talked her husband into naming their daughter 'love,' knowing that while the child might be teased, she would grow up stronger and thank her one day. 

as expected, when love started school, she endured much of the same teasing that darling did, all because of her strange name.

one day, love simply had had enough. she came home from school very angry and screamed at her dad, asking why her parents gave her such a stupid name.

the husband, being a good man, took the blame of naming her to protect his wife and apologized.

in a fit of rage, love shot him with her dart gun and ran away.

minutes later, darling came home and saw her husband lying on the ground.

109288,What could possibly be making such a seductive sound?,"a man is driving down the road and his car breaks down near a monastery. he goes to the monastery, knocks on the door, and says, “my car broke down. do you think i could stay the night?”

the monks graciously accept him, feed him dinner, even fix his car. as the man tries to fall asleep, he hears a strange sound. a sound unlike anything he’s ever heard before. the sirens that nearly seduced odysseus into crashing his ship comes to his mind. he doesn’t sleep that night. he tosses and turns trying to figure out what could possibly be making such a seductive sound.

the next morning, he asks the monks what the sound was, but they say, “we can’t tell you. you’re not a monk.” distraught, the man is forced to leave.

years later, after never being able to forget that sound, the man goes back to the monastery and pleads for the answer again.

the monks reply, “we can’t tell you. you’re not a monk.”

the man says, “if the only way i can find out what is making that beautiful sound is to become a monk, then please, make me a monk.”

the monks reply, “you must travel the earth and tell us how many blades of grass there are and the exact number of grains of sand. when you find these answers, you will have become a monk.”
the man sets about his task.

after years of searching he returns as a gray-haired old man and knocks on the door of the monastery. a monk answers. he is taken before a gathering of all the monks.

“in my quest to find what makes that beautiful sound, i traveled the earth and have found what you asked for: by design, the world is in a state of perpetual change. only god knows what you ask. all a man can know is himself, and only then if he is honest and reflective and willing to strip away self deception.”

the monks reply, “congratulations. you have become a monk. we shall now show you the way to the mystery of the sacred sound.”

the monks lead the man to a wooden door, where the head monk says, “the sound is beyond that door.”

the monks give him the key, and he opens the door. behind the wooden door is another door made of stone. the man is given the key to the stone door and he opens it, only to find a door made of ruby. and so it went that he needed keys to doors of emerald, pearl and diamond.

finally, they come to a door made of solid gold. the sound has become very clear and definite. the monks say, “this is the last key to the last door.”

the man is apprehensive to no end. his life’s wish is behind that door!

with trembling hands, he unlocks the door, turns the knob, and slowly pushes the door open. falling to his knees, he is utterly amazed to discover the source of that haunting and seductive sound……

but, of course, i can’t tell you what it is because you’re not a monk…

58520,There was this tramp.," 

one cold winter's morning he was walking along a country road, when he heard a cry for help from a nearby lake.

without a moment's hesitation he ran out onto the ice and slipped and slid over to a little girl. he managed to pull her out without breaking the ice further and carried her back to the road. he took off his coat and wrapped her in it then began looking for a car to flag down.

coincidentally the father drives up. ""how can i ever thank you sir?"" he says after putting his daughter into the warmth of the limo. ""just name your price - i'm a wealthy man.""

""ah, well..."" stammers the tramp, ""... uh, i'm a little short of cash, perhaps you could help me out.""

""oh dear,"" says the father, ""i don't carry much cash with me, i only have ten pounds - but come home with me and i'll get more from the safe.""

""no! no!"" says the tramp, ""why ten pounds is more money than i've seen in my whole life - that'll be plenty.""

""ten pounds,"" thinks the tramp, ""i'm rich! i'm rich!"" and off he goes to the town to buy himself a holiday.

he finds a travel agent, walks in - much to the disgust of the staff - and goes up to the desk. ""i'll have one holiday please!""

""ahem, which holiday would sir like?"" asked the girl at the desk, forcing a smile.

""oh, any holiday i don't mind, anything up to ten pounds,"" replies the tramp.

""ten pounds! you'll never get a holiday for ten pounds,"" says the girl incredulously.

she goes into the back of the shop, and searches in the deepest, dustiest filing drawers she can find. there - to her amazement - she finds an old file.

""well you'll never believe it,"" she says to the tramp, back in the shop. ""i've got you a holiday - its a super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class round the world cruise - and it costs ten pounds.""

""yippee!"" exclaims the tramp, ""i'll take it!""

a few days later he arrives at the port, and there in the dock is the most beautiful, most elaborately decorated, most expensive looking ocean-going liner he has ever seen.

""get off my ship ye dirty bum!"" shouts a voice, and an irate captain storms down the gangplank and kicks the tramp down onto the dockside.

""but i've got my ticket!"", responds the tramp, ""super-duper, ultra-hyper, mega-economy class, and i want on!""

""well okay,"" says the captain, ""but you can't come on just now, i don't want my first-class passengers seeing you. come back at midnight when it's dark and i'll let you on then.""

so the tramp finds himself a quiet spot among some cargo cases on the dockside, and he falls asleep.

""psst,"" says a voice, waking him with a start. it was the captain.

""hurry up, it's midnight, let's get you to your cabin.""

the tramp toddles after the captain, along the dockside, up the gangway, and onto the ship - and what a ship!

first they went down through the first class level: oriental carpets - 6"" pile. a genuine rembrandt on every wall. leave your shoes outside for cleaning, and the steward brings a new pair. 24 ct gold trim everywhere.

then the second class: as above, but perhaps the carpets were only 3"" deep, and so on...

3rd, 4th, 5th class, down past the casinos, and the ballrooms, down through the crew's quarters, down through the galleys, and the engine rooms, until finally, at the lowest point in the ship, against the very hull, the captain opens a watertight door into a tiny 7' x 4' cabin, with a hammock, a bedside table, and an alarm clock.

""sheer luxury!"" exclaimed the tramp, ""a room of my very own.""

""i'm glad you like it,"" replies the captain, ""but there is one more thing... your class of ticket only allows you to use the facilities of the ship, at night - when all the other passengers are asleep. so that's what the alarm clock is for. enjoy your cruise.""

well the cruise began, and the tramp had a whale of a time. sleeping by day, and up on deck at night - he loved it. one-man-tennis, clay pigeon shooting, more food than he'd ever seen...

then one morning, a week or so into the cruise, the tramp decided he'd have a go on the diving board of the pool. he had just enough time for one dive before he had to go below.

he climbed up the ladder, stepped onto the board tip, bounced, and dived...

... and what a dive...!

perfectly poised in the air, he hit the water without so much as a ripple.

now unknown to him, the captain - who'd grown rather fond of the poor old tramp - was standing watching this.

""that was amazing!"" exclaimed the captain, ""where did you learn to dive like that?""

""um, well i've never actually dived before,"" replied the tramp.

""well that's incredible!"" says the captain, ""i've never seen..."" he broke off. ""hey, i've got an idea"", he started again. ""how would you like to train a bit, and we'll put on a show for the other passengers. i'll pay you, and you can then afford to go first class!""

""it's a deal!"" says our man. for the next 3 weeks the tramp practices like he's never practiced before. back-flips, front-flips, triple-back sideways axled dives, you name it he tried it.

then one morning the captain comes to talk. ""okay, i'd like you to stay in your cabin for the next 2 days. we're going to erect a high diving board for you.""

""okay,"" agreed the tramp.

two days passed, and the big day arrived. the ship was humming with excitement. everyone wanted to see the mystery diver. the captain had provided the tramp with a new pair of swimming trunks and he wore these as he stepped out onto the sun-beaten deck. gasps of astonishment from the crowd, and a hushed awe. higher than the eye could see, towering up and up, rose a slender column of metal.

""well, tramp,"" said the captain, shaking his hand, ""let's see what you can do."" and with that the captain handed him a walkie talkie. and the tramp began to climb...

up and up...

below him the ship grew smaller...

on and on...

past a solitary albatross...

and still higher...

till the ship was but a speck on the ocean below...

and on still further...

/ till the ocean grew dim...

and the earth itself...

began to shrink...

past our moon...

and on...

and mars...

and on...

higher, and higher...

through the asteroid belt...

and on and on towards the diving board...

past the outer planets, until...

on the outermost reaches of the solar system...

he reached the board.

he climbed on top and radioed the captain...

and by now the earth was growing large in the distance, the oceans and land masses grew clear,

double-back somersault,

and he could see the ship, tiny in the distance,

hurtling down now, he posed, ready for the final 500 feet,

down on the ship the crew strained their necks,

""i can see him!"" yelled a passenger, ""look!!!""

the tramp streaked down towards the pool, did a last triple flip, and dove...

not a ripple on the surface!

down through the water!

smashed through the pool bottom!

down through the first deck!

smashing through the second!

down!

and down through the double-strength steel hull of the ship!

still down...!

smash!

into the sea bed, sinking a 37' shaft in the process.

desperate for air he struggle out of the shaft, his lungs bursting he swam frantically for the surface.

up and up, desperate, gasping...

out of the water, up the ladder onto the deck of the ship, into a throng wild with acclaim.

""hero!"" ""wonderful!"" ""amazing!"" ""good show that!""

and handing him a heated towel the captain spoke, as a hush fell over the crowd.

""well tramp, i have never seen anything like that, ever. that was the most \*stupendous\* piece of diving i have ever seen.""

the tramp blushed.

the captain went on, ""but tell me, most amazing of all is how you survived smashing through this boat after you dived - how did you do it.""

and the tramp looked at the captain, and the crowd and replied modestly: ""well you see...

i'm a just poor tramp...

so you must understand...

one sunday, in the pulpit, he said, ""if i hear one more person confess to adultery, i'll quit this position!""

since everyone liked him, they came up with a code word. someone who had committed adultery would say instead that they had 'fallen.' 

this seemed to satisfy the old priest and things went well until the priest passed away at a ripe old age of 80.

a few days after the new priest arrived, he visited the mayor of the town and seemed very concerned. 

""mayor, you have to do something about the sidewalks in town. when people come into the confessional, they keep telling me they've fallen."" 

the mayor started to laugh, realizing that no one had told the new priest about the code word. but, before he could explain, the priest shook an accusing finger at him and shouted, ""i don't know what you're laughing about, because your wife has fallen three times this week!""",4,3154,66,1566542816.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cua5dg/there_was_an_old_priest/

so, now, i stand behind the fence by the knot hole, real quiet, with my hedge clippers. every time some guy sticks his thing through my fence, i surprise him, grab hold of it and say, 'o.k., buddy! give me $20, or off it comes.'

119676,"In 1986, Peter Davies was on holiday in Kenya after graduating from Louisiana State University .","on a hike through the bush, he came across a young bull elephant standing with one leg raised in the air. the elephant seemed distressed, so peter approached it very carefully. he got down on one knee, inspected the elephants foot, and found a large piece of wood deeply embedded in it. as carefully and as gently as he could, peter worked the wood out with his knife, after which the elephant gingerly put down its foot.
the elephant turned to face the man and with a rather curious look on its face, stared at him for several tense moments. peter stood frozen, thinking of nothing else but being trampled. eventually the elephant trumpeted loudly, turned and walked away. peter never forgot that elephant or the events of that day.

twenty years later, peter was walking through the chicago zoo with his teenaged son. as they approached the elephant enclosure, one of the creatures turned and walked over to near where peter and his son cameron were standing. the large bull elephant stared at peter, lifted its front foot off the ground, then put it down. the elephant did that several times then trumpeted loudly, all the while staring at the man.

remembering the encounter in 1986, peter could not help wondering if this was the same elephant. peter summoned up his courage, climbed over the railing and made his way into the enclosure. he walked right up to the elephant and stared back in wonder. the elephant trumpeted again, wrapped its trunk around one of peter legs and slammed him against the railing, killing him instantly.

probably wasn't the same fucking elephant.

28010,"Once upon a time in an old magical kingdom, there lived an young monk called Sam...","his order was renowned for their beautiful choral
singing. they trained, hours every day, refining
their voices and their art. their song floated
down the mountainside, enriching the lives and
souls of the townspeople below

sam was particularly gifted, and on his 19th
birthday, in mid-song, he hit upon a beautifully
intricate note of pure magic. everyone within
miles just froze in mid action, stirred to the very
core of their souls by the pure bliss of the tone.
and all the realm realized, instantly, that it was
sam, and sam was the first person in history
to hit one of the rumored magical notes that
musicians had theorized must exist... yet no one
before sam had ever reached one.

and on sam's 20th birthday, it happened again.
this time, the town below was so impacted
that no one moved, spoke, or even blink for
several minutes after. as the golden sound finally
tapered off and ceased, they knew that sam had
found the second note...

and the next year on sam's birthday, the town
had realized there was a pattern involved. this
time, all of the townspeople were present in the
monastery's nave, watching in awe, as sam hit
the glorious third note. people cried out in purepure
joy as the sound grew to a glorious crescendo.
words cannot do justice to the experience. the
town flourished, as sam's notes made the people
pure all the way to the core of their beings.

and on it went for the next few years, the magical
notes growing sweeter and sweeter... until, that
is, sam's 25th birthday. all at first seemed as nor
mal... until sam hit the magical note. from the
start, sam seemed very uncomfortable, and this
new sound was not beautiful... it was jarring and
discordant. sam started to get very warm, and
was visibly sweating onstage. he doubled his
resolve and dug deeper, to get to the sweet part
of the magical note that he knew must be there.

suddenly, to the horror of all, sam spontaneously
combusted! the two closest monks on stage
were burned by the flames coming off of his
body, and he ignited the stage curtains. soon
the entire monastery was aflame. by a miracle,
everyone made it out, except for poor sam

the townsfolk were left staring at the burning
monastery in sad, stunned disbelief.

the mayor approached the lead monk of the
order. ""what happened?"" he asked, exasperated

the old monk shook his head sadly. ""isn't it
obvious?"" he said. ""sam sung note 7.""

as i looked up, i noticed she was wearing a low-cut blouse with cleavage to die for...

""i'm okay i think,"" i replied as i pulled myself up to the side of the car to get a closer look.

she said, “get in and i’ll take you home, so i can clean and bandage that nasty scrape on your head.”

well, she was pretty and very persuasive. being sort of shaken and weak, i agreed, but repeated, ""i'm sure my wife won't like this.""

""this is your house now,  here are your keys."" the man is happy and thanks the devil. the devil  says:""no need to say thank you, everyone gets a nice place to live in  when they come down here!""

they  continue walking through the nice park, flowers everywhere, and the  devil shows the atheist a garage full of beautiful cars.

they  walk on and the area gets even nicer. there are birds chirping,  squirrels running around, kittens everywhere. they arrive at a fountain,  where the most beautiful woman the atheist has ever seen sits on a  bench. she looks at him and they instantly fall in love with each other.  the man couldn´t be any happier. the devil says ""everyone gets to have  their soulmate down here, we don´t want anyone to be lonely!""

as  they walk on, the atheist notices a high fence. he peeks to the other  side and is totally shocked. there are people in pools of lava,  screaming in pain, while little devils run around and stab them with  their tridents. other devils are skinning people alive, heads are  spiked, and many more terrible things are happening. a stench of sulfur  is in the air.

terrified, the man  stumbles backwards, and asks the devil ""what is going on there?"" the  devil just shrugs and says: ""those are the christians, i don´t know why,  but they prefer it that way"".

110456,An old dime store novel writer walks into a saloon...,"an old west dime novel writer is out looking for a good story when he wanders into a saloon. he sees a group of rough rider lookin' scoundrels playing poker and he musters up enough courage to sit down with 'em (thinkin' he might get a story out if he was lucky). ""mind if i play?""

the others look up with a scowl that would curdle milk, but one looks at the clock and shakes his head. he points out the time to the others and they gather up their chips and go. ""play alone, we're a-leavin'. wild bill's comin' to town.""

the writer is confused, but smells a story brewing; a strong one at that. he hoofs it up to the bar, passing most other patrons on their way out, and slaps a whole dollar bill on the table, ""barkeep, give me a beer and a story, and you can keep the change.""

after taking a quick glance at the clock, the bartender shakes his head, pours the beer, and pushes the bill back to the reporter. ""the drink is on the house, but i suggest you drink it quick and leave. wild bill is coming to town."" without another word the 'tender puts his last glass away and walks right out the swinging doors, leaving the reporter in an empty bar.

now fear in his gut tears at him as he hears the emptiness in that bar. this emptiness seems to seep in as he realizes that he's about to be the last man in this town, alone with only the sound of that ticking clock to keep him company. still, a story of this caliber must be worth something; so he waits...

tick, tock, tick, tock, tick, bong<crack!>- just as the clock strikes the first chime of twelve, a sound like thunder splitting a mountain is heard outside. the reporter runs to the doors to see what it is. in the distance and closing fast is a tornado coming right for the bar. the reporter hits the ground and watches as the tornado comes up to the bar and stops.

the wind settles and there is a giant of a man riding a grizzly bear. he steps off the bear, and instead of hitching it, he punches the great beast right in the face <wham!>, knocking it cold on the ground.

the reporter is so scared he runs back into the bar and dives behind the counter, sure that this is the last of his days. <kaplow!> the giant kicks in the saloon doors, and they turn to splinters that imbed themselves into the walls and break bottles and glasses that they touch.

the man walks up to the bar, breaking every floor board with each thundering step. he looks down at the reporter and slams his fist on the bar, cracking it down the middle, ""gimme a drink!""

the reporter comes up, shakily holding out two bottles of whisky; which the giant snatches up, chews the glass tops off of, and drinks down as fast as the amber liquid can spill from the bottles. he throws both bottles in the air, whips out his six-shooter and fires off a round. the single bullet rips through both bottles showering the reporter with shards that rain down.

regretting his curiosity and repenting of his life, the reporter stands on weakened legs and whimpers out, ""w-w-w-would y-you like a-another drink?""

the man turns to him, fire in his eyes, then glances at the clock... ""nah, i gotta go. wild bill's comin' to town.""",4,646,40,1574312617.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dzecoj/an_old_dime_store_novel_writer_walks_into_a_saloon/

71638,"A day before his fifteenth birthday, the son of a wealthy family was asked by his father, “Well my son, what would you like for your birthday?”","the son hesitated a moment and his father's thoughts leapt ahead to a new computer and similar things. however, his son had had a new computer only recently and could have a new one any time he wished.

finally, the son said, `father, i have everything a boy could wish for, but there is one thing i would really like. i would love to have a pink ping pong ball.'

the father was rather astonished at this wish, but said, `if it is a pink ping pong ball that you want, a pink ping pong ball you shall have.'

and so, the next day, the son was given as his bithday present a pink ping pong ball.

the boy took the ball to his room and the next morning the pink ping pong ball was gone. the father was mildly surprised but decided not to say anything. the pink ping pong ball, however, was never seen again.

the next year, a day before his 16th birthday, the father asked his son what he would like for his birthday.

`father,' replied the son, `i have everything a boy could possibly wish for, but there is one thing i would really, really like. i would love to have a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'

the father was more surprised than the year before, but kept his curiosity at bay, for he knew that his son had a right for privacy. he said therefore, `if it is a tenpack of pink ping pong balls that you want, a tenpack of pink ping pong balls you shall have.'

and so, the next day, the son was given as his birthday present a tenpack of pink ping pong balls.

the boy took the tenpack of balls to his room and the next morning, not a single ball remained, merely the empty husk of the tenpack. the father wondered where ten pink ping pong balls might disappear to, but decided not to say anything. the pink ping pong balls, however, were never seen again.

the next year, a day before his 17th birthday, the son was asked by his father what he would like for his birthday.

`father,' said the son to this, `i have everything a boy could wish for, but one thing would make my happiness complete. i would dearly want a carton of pink ping pong balls.'

the father was beyond surprise, but decided to make sure he had not misheard. `a carton of pink ping pong balls?'

`a carton of pink ping pong balls,' the boy confirmed.

`i can't understand your fascination with pink ping pong balls,' said the father, `but if it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you want, it is a carton of pink ping pong balls that you shall have.'

and so, the next day, the boy was given as his birthday present a carton of pink ping pong balls.

the boy was delighted and took the carton to his room. the next day, miraculously (as if by magic, even) the pink ping pong balls had all disappeared.

`dear son,' said the father, `i must ask now, what do you do with all those pink ping pong balls?'

the son, however, was reluctant to tell him. `please humour me, dear father.'

the carton of pink ping pong balls, however, was never seen again.

the next year, it was clear that the son would get a car, but the father felt that, perhaps, his son also had some other wish apart from the obvious. so, one day before the son's 18th birthday, the father asked him whether he had a special wish for his birthday.

”dearest father,” the son started, `i have everything a young man could possibly want, but there is one craving in me. i would, more than anything, want a warehouse full of pink ping pong balls.'

one of these years, his father thought, i should get to the bottom of this. however, he decided to humour his son's wish. at least he had been wise enough to buy shares in a pink ping pong ball factory.

the next day, the son was given the address of a warehouse where all his new pink ping pong balls were stored. the son was delighted and decided to spend the next night in the warehouse rather than at home.

the following morning, the son stepped out of the warehouse, but it seemed to be empty otherwise. the father had a closer look and indeed, apart from empty cardboard boxes, nothing was left inside the warehouse. no pink ping pong balls were left.

the following year, one day before the son's 19th birthday, the father braced himself for another warehouse of pink ping pong balls. he asked his son what his deepest desire was and he had not been entirely wrong.

`father, you have made me very happy these last years and this year i ask of you a shipload of pink ping pong balls if at all possible.'

it was possible, if only because the father had by now bought each and every factory of pink ping pong balls in the country.

the next day, the father took his son to the harbour and showed him a huge tanker and told his son that there were millions, billions, trillions of pink ping pong balls in there.

“father,” the son said, `you've made me very happy yet again.'

that night, the son spent on board the tanker.

the next morning, not a single of the pink ping pong balls could be found, but the son was happy.

a few days before his 20th birthday, however, the son had a terrible road accident and was taken to the hospital.

his father visited the young man in hospital. `my dear son! can i bring you anything to make you feel better?'

weakly, the son sat up in bed. `father, dearest father, grant me this wish; just one tenpack of pink ping pong balls.'

the father held his son's hand tightly. `whatever you wish my son, but i have to give you one condition. even if it may be embarrassing, i must know what you did with all those pink ping pong balls.'

`very well, father, but please indulge me first. i will tell you whatever you wish to know after you have given me the ten pink ping pong balls.'

the father thought that was fair enough and the next day brought his son the ten asked for pink ping pong balls. the son smiled weakly but seemed too weak to talk.

`son, i leave these pink ping pong balls with you and shall come back tomorrow to ask of you what you have done with all those pink ping pong balls.'

the son nodded weakly.

the next day, less than surprisingly, no pink ping pong balls could be found in the son's hospital room.

`now, my dearest son, apple of my eye, treasure of my life, please tell me what you did with all those pink ping pong balls,' the father requested.

the son nodded and the father gripped his hand tighter.

`i-' the son started and sat up a bit, swallowing with a dry mouth.

`i- i-'

16233,A man Wakes Up,"a man wakes up in a dingy slum with no memory of how he got there. he wanders around aimlessly before he finds even one person who will talk to him. some ratty beggar on the street turns out to be nice enough to explain where he is.

&#x200b;

""you're in the afterlife!"" he tells the man, ""but you must have been a real shithead when you were alive, because this is the fourth ring, and only the worst people come here.""

&#x200b;

all of a sudden, a siren goes off, one of those air-raid things. the man is terrified but the beggar gets up calmly and leads him to a big, dilapidated warehouse where thousands of other similarly unkempt souls are gathering. when the man asks why they're all here, the beggar points to a line of folding tables against the wall. each table has some moldy bread, cups of dingy water, and some bowls of broth so thin they could have just run out of cups. only then does the man realize how hungry he is. a guard in heavy body armor blows a whistle and all the people arrange themselves into three lines.

&#x200b;

the beggar is helpful enough to explain them for the man. ""that one's the bread line, that's the broth line, and that's the water line. all the food here is free, but if you want to get out of this maggot hole, you've got to work, because the gate guards into the third ring ask five hundred dollars to get through. i've heard the food is better there.""

&#x200b;

so the man gets his food. it's abominable, and right then and there, he vows to make five hundred dollars and get into the third ring. unfortunately for him, very few people need work in the afterlife, especially when all of them are saving up to emigrate. even still, after ten years of hard work, eating the moldy bread and indistinguishable soup and water, he finally saves up enough money. the guards let him through and he finds himself in the third ring. it's nothing too fancy, if anything, it's a bit below average for a real city, but to his eyes it is paradise. all the guards look much friendlier, and the houses and buildings, while not spacious or lavish, are at least up to code. and to his surprise, he runs right into a familiar former beggar as he crosses the street.

&#x200b;

""what are the odds?"" they both ask and they get to conversing. the beggar, it turns out, only managed to make it in himself a few months back. their conversation is interrupted, however, by what sounds like a school bell. when the man seems confused, the beggar leads him to what looks like a giant gymnasium. here, people are gathering once again, and the man begins to understand. on a line of folding tables against one wall are stacks of hot dogs, big bowls of salad, and solo cups full of fresh lemonade. a cop shouts for everyone's attention and directs them all to stand in three lines. the beggar smiles at the man's wonder and points to each line in turn. ""that's the hot dog line, that's the salad line, and that's the lemonade line."" the man gets in each line in turn and gets himself his lunch.

&#x200b;

while he's eating, basking in joy at not being stuck with old bread and water, the beggar encourages him, ""the best part is, halfway through the year, they switch from hot dogs, salad, and lemonade to chicken, chili, and hot chocolate. you can never get tired of it!""

&#x200b;

sadly, this proved not to be true. after only a few days, the man did again get tired of the same meal every day. but he knew firsthand that he could change his lot, so one day he went up to the wall of the second circle. this time the guards were asking for ten thousand dollars. well, the man didn't like it, but he figured he had his whole afterlife ahead of him now that he was out of the fourth circle, and he could certainly take some time to save up. after ten years of hard work, it wasn't too difficult for him to keep up the work ethic, and only twenty years later, he went back to the guards of the second ring with the money in hand. he went through the gate and found himself in a glittering, clean city full of glass and steel.

&#x200b;

and wouldn't you know it, but there, standing across the street was the same beggar, only now he was wearing a well-fitted suit. the man greeted the beggar as an old friend and they started talking again. once again, their conversation was interrupted, only this time it was by beautiful church bells. ""come,"" the beggar told him, ""i'll take you to the evening meal."" so the man followed and they entered a glamorous ballroom filled with beautiful attendees. even the cops here looked good, dressed in suits and sunglasses like bodyguards. and sure enough, piled onto platters on huge mahogany tables against the far wall were plates of steak, bowls of the most delicious seafood soups, and glasses of champagne. one of the bodyguards cleared his throat loudly and politely requested that the attendees line up. three lines were formed and the beggar pointed each line out in turn. ""that's the steak line, that's the soup line, and that's the champagne line,"" and then he added, ""and apparently here, they change the meals four times a year!""

&#x200b;

the man rejoiced, ate, and was happy, and for once felt that nothing was lacking. four changes a year was enough for him. but one day, out of curiosity, he went up to the bodyguards that guarded the gate into the first and final ring of the afterlife and found they were asking for a million dollars to pass. well the man was a bit disturbed by this, after all, the second ring seemed perfect to him. ""what is it,"" he thought, ""that could possibly be more wonderful than what i have here?"" that question haunted him for weeks until he came to a conclusion. he was used to working hard and he had all of eternity to save up, so he wanted, just once to see what he could possibly be missing in the first ring.

&#x200b;

fifty years later, he returned to the guards with a million dollars. when he stepped into the first ring he fell to his knees. the architecture was glorious and inhuman, and the bodyguard had turned into shining angels. to his surprise, someone helped him up off the street and when he looked, he realized he recognized who it was--it was the beggar he met in the fourth ring, adorned in a golden robe and glowing, and when he looked down at himself he realized he looked much the same.

&#x200b;

the beggar laughed jovially. ""i got here only three years ago myself, but somehow i knew you would be right here behind me. i've come back to this gate every day waiting for you to make it in!"" suddenly, the air was filled with the sound of angelic choirs and the beggar led the man off to a gigantic palace made of crystal and cloud. the room was filled with radiant citizens of the first circle and angels prepared everything. sure enough, there was a line of massive altars against one wall, spilling over with glistening golden dragon meat, a pudding refined from clouds and dew and silk, and an ice cold tub of ambrosia and nectar ladled out individually into blindingly beautiful crystalline chalices. an angel fluttered from the ceiling and bowed silently to the assembled mass, who bowed respectfully back and then broke themselves into their lines on their own.

&#x200b;

smiling at the tradition, the beggar pointed to the first line. ""that's the line for the dragon meat,"" he said before turning to the next line, ""and that's the line for angeldust stew,"" then he paused, confused.

&#x200b;

""what is it?"" the man asked his old friend.

&#x200b;

the beggar replied, ""there appears to be no punchline.""",4,57,20,1550531347.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/as3dr2/a_man_wakes_up/

two jewish men, sid and al, were sitting in an indian restaurant in new york. sid asked al, 'are there any jewish people of our faith born and raised in india?'
 
al replied, 'i don't know, let's just ask our waiter.'

when the waiter came by, al asked him, 'are there any indian jews?'

the waiter said, 'i won't be knowing, but i will ask the chef. after he returned from the kitchen a few minutes later and said, 'no sir, no indian jews.'
 
al wasn't really satisfied with that and asked, 'are you absolutely sure?'

the waiter, realizing he was dealing with 'foreigners' gave the expected answer, 'i check again,' and went back into the kitchen.

the kingdoms eventually go to war over control of the lake, as it's a valuable resource to have. the first kingdom sends 100 of its finest knights, clad in the best armour and each with their own personal squire. the second kingdom sends 50 knights, with fine leather armour and a few dozen squires of their own. the third kingdom sends their one and only knight, an elderly warrior who has long since passed his prime, with his own personal squire. 


the night before the big battle, the knights in the first kingdom drink and party into the late hours of the night. the knights in the second kingdom aren't as well off, but have their own supply of grog and drink well into the night. 


in the third camp, the faithful squire gets a rope and swings it over the branch of a tall tree, making a noose, and hangs a pot from it. he fills the pot with stew and has a humble dinner with the old knight. 


the next morning, the knights in the first two kingdoms are hungover and unable to fight, while the knight in the third kingdom is old weary, unable to get up. in place of the knights, the squires from all three kingdoms go and fight. the battle lasts long into the night but by the time the dust settled, only one squire was left standing - the squire from the third kingdom. 


and it just goes to show you that the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.

""i didn't ask for any details"", the lawyer interrupted. ""just answer the question, ...please. did you, or did you not say, at the scene of the accident, 'i'm fine!'?"" 

clyde said, ""well, i had just got bessie into the trailer behind the tractor and i was driving down the road...."" 

the lawyer interrupted again and said, ""your honor, i am trying to establish the fact that, at the scene of the accident, this man told the highway patrolman on the scene that he was just fine. now several weeks after the accident he is trying to sue my client. i believe he is a fraud. please tell him to simply answer the question."" 

by this time, the judge was fairly interested in clyde's answer and said to the lawyer, ""i'd like to hear what he has to say about his favorite cow, bessie"". 

clyde thanked the judge and proceeded. ""well, as i was saying, i had just loaded bessie, my favorite cow, into the trailer and was driving her down the highway when this huge semi-truck and trailer ran the stop sign and smacked my john deer tractor right in the side. i was thrown into one ditch and bessie was thrown into the other. i was hurting, real bad and didn't want to move. however, i could hear old bessie moaning and groaning. i knew she was in terrible shape just by her groans.

shortly after the accident a highway patrolman came on the scene. he could hear bessie moaning and groaning, so he went over to her. after he looked at her, and saw her fatal condition, he took out his gun and shot her between the eyes. then the patrolman came across the road, gun still in hand, looked at me, and said, ""how are you feeling?""

92127,Why the head of the penis is larger than the shaft.," 

several years ago, great britain funded a study to determine why the head on a mans' penis is larger than the shaft. the study took two years and cost over $1.2 million. the study concluded that the reason the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft was to provide the man with more pleasure during sex.

after the results were published, france decided to conduct their own study on the same subject. they were convinced that the results of the british study was incorrect. after three years of research at a cost of in excess of $2 million, the french researchers concluded that the head of a man's penis is larger than the shaft to provide the woman with more pleasure during sex.

when the results of the french study were released, australia decided to conduct their own study. the aussies didnt really trust british or french studies. so, after nearly three hours of intensive research and a cost of right around $75.00 ( 3 cases of beer), the aussie study was complete. they concluded that the reason the head on a man's penis is larger than the shaft is to prevent your hand from flying off and hitting you in the forehead",3,1889,131,1569543386.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/d9sige/why_the_head_of_the_penis_is_larger_than_the_shaft/

49193,Just 4 old ladies taking a drive...," 

a state police officer sees a car puttering along at 22 mph. he thinks to himself “this driver is just as dangerous as a speeder!” so he turns on his lights and pulls the driver over.  
approaching the car, he notices that there are four old ladies — the three passengers are wide eyed and white as ghosts.  
the driver, obviously confused, says to him, “officer, i don’t understand, i was doing exactly the speed limit! what seems to be the problem?”  
the officer replies, “ma’am, you weren’t speeding, but you should know that driving much slower than the speed limit can also be a danger to other drivers.”  
“slower than the speed limit? no sir, i was doing the speed limit exactly... twenty-two miles an hour!” the old woman says, pointing to a sign next to the road.  
the state police officer, trying to contain a chuckle explains to her that the sign was the route number, not the speed limit. a bit embarrassed, the woman grinned and thanked the officer for pointing out her error.   
“but before i let you go, ma’am, i have to ask... is everyone in this car ok? your passengers seem awfully shaken and they haven’t muttered a single peep this whole time,” the officer asks.

while waiting for the coffee machine to finish brewing, the colonel decided to pose a question to all assembled.

he explained that his wife had been a bit frisky the night before and he failed to get his usual amount of sound sleep.

he posed the question of just how much of sex was “work” and how much of it was “pleasure?”

a major chimed in with 75%-25% in favor of work.

a captain said it was 50%-50%.

a lieutenant responded with 25%-75% in favor of pleasure, depending upon his state of inebriation at the time.

there being no consensus, the colonel turned to the private first class who was in charge of making the coffee and asked for his opinion?

without any hesitation, the young private first class responded, “sir, it has to be 100% pleasure.

the colonel was surprised and as you might guess, asked why?

""so, you're a politician..."" ""well, yes, is that a problem?"" ""oh no, no problem. but we've recently adopted a new system for people in your line of work, and unfortunately you will have to spend a day in hell. after that however, you're free to choose where you want to spend eternity!""

""wait, i have to spend a day in hell??"" says the politician. ""them's the rules"" says st peter, clicks his fingers, and woomph, the guy dissapears... and awakes, curled up with his hands over his eyes, knowing he's in hell. cautiously, he listens for the screams, sniffs the air for brimstone, and finds... nothing. just the smell of, is that fabric softener? and cut grass, this can't be right?

""open your eyes!"" says a voice. ""c'mon, wakey wakey, we've only got 24 hours!"". nervously, he uncovers his eyes, looks around, and sees he's in a hotel room. a nice one too. wait, this is a penthouse suite... and there's a smiling man in a suit, holding a martini. ""who are you??"" the politician asks. ""well, i'm satan!"" says the man, handing him the drink and helping him to his feet. ""welcome to hell!"" ""wait, this is hell? but... where's all the pain and suffering?"" he asks. satan throws him a wink. ""oh, we've been a bit mis-represented over the years, it's a long story. anyway, this is your room! the minibar is of course free, as is the room service, there's extra towels next to the hot-tub, and if you need anything, just call reception. but enough of this! it's a beautiful day, and if you'd care to look outside..."" slightly stunned by the opulent surroundings, the man wanders over to the floor-to-ceiling windows through which the sun is glowing, looks far down, and sees a group of people cheering and waving at him from a golf course. ""it's one of 5 pro-level courses on site, and there's another 6 just a few minutes drive out past the beach and harbour!"" says satan, answering his unasked question. so they head down in the lift, walk out through the glittering lobby where everyone waves and welcomes the man, as satan signs autographs and cherrily talks shop with the laughing staff. and as he walks out, he sees the group on the golf course are made up of every one of his old friends, people he's admired for years but never met or worked with, and people whose work he's admired but died long before his career started. and out of the middle of this group walks his wife, with a massive smile and the body she had when she was 20, who throws her arms around him and plants a delicate kiss on his cheek. everyone cheers and applauds, and as they slap him on the back and trade jokes, his worst enemy arrives, as a 2 foot tall goblin-esque caddy. he spends the day in the bright sunshine on the course, having the time of his life laughing at jokes and carrying important discussions, putting the world to rights with his friends while holding his delighted wife next to him as she gazes lovingly at him. later, they return to the hotel for dinner and have an enormous meal, perfectly cooked, which descends into a food-fight when someone accidentally throws a bread roll at the next table (where ghandi is having a game of truth-or-dare with marylin monroe). as everyone is falling about laughing and flinging breadsticks at each other, his wife whispers in his ear... and they return to their penthouse suite, and spend the rest of the night making love like they did on their honeymoon. after 6 hours of intense passion, the man falls deep into the 100% egyptian cotton pillows, and falls into a deep and happy sleep... and is woken up by st peter. ""so, that was hell. wasn't what you were expecting, i bet?"" ""no sir!"" says the man.

the man wakes up in total darkness, the stench of ammonia filling the air and distant screams the only noise. as he adjusts, he can see the only light is from belches of flame far away, illuminating the ragged remains of people being tortured or burning in a sulphurous ocean. a sudden bolt of lightning reveals satan next to him, wearing the same suit as before and grinning, holding a soldering iron in one hand and a coil of razor-wire in the other.

51291,The caretaker of a generation ship was on his death bed,"many years before, jacques had helped place all his friends and family into cryogenic sleep. he was a young man then and they all knew that he would likely be long dead by the time they reached their destination. they said their tearful goodbyes and drifted off to sleep.

in the years he spent alone on the ship, he became adept at building small robots to help him complete his tasks. he formed relationships with the little bots, but he found he missed the companionship of real humans. he would take small stints in the cryogenic chambers in order to prolong his life, so as to complete his mission of getting his friends and family to their new home. he didn't want to wake anyone to take over his duties and suffer the loneliness of space travel. but a long life with no one real to talk to is lacking.

with his knowledge of robotics, he took it upon himself to build an artificial human. something that looked real. something that felt real. something that would make the unbearable loneliness go away.

he didn’t feel right copying the likeness of any members of the sleeping crew, so he modeled the robot on himself. by the time he was done, there “he” was, a perfect replica of jacques himself. he named the robot jacques 2.0, because who else was there to get confused? and as he grew older, it would be easier to remember his own name, he figured.

well, years passed as they are wont to do. he grew old and frail on the journey, but jacques 2.0 remained young and spry, helping his creator to complete the tasks the old man’s bones could no longer handle.

as the old man lay dying, he asked his robotic companion to do him a favor. he wanted his remains to be scattered among the stars, the asteroids, and the comets they passed. he did not want to be buried on a planet he would never see, but instead live on in the vastness of space that had become his home. so when the day finally came, jacques 2.0 sent his creator’s ashes out of the airlock and into the universe.

but the journey was not over. jacques 2.0 carried on his creator’s duties for years and helped the crew arrive on their new home. as the ship grew close to the planet, the crew began to wake up. one by one they woke from their long sleep and travelled to the observation deck to see their new home. when they arrived, though, they found themselves in complete shock. there was jacques, as lively and youthful as ever, waiting for them.

“how can this be?” they asked. “surely, you would at the very least be an old, old man by now. it has been so long since we left earth.”

jacques 2.0 raised his hands slightly in a calming gesture and said, “do not worry. i am here to send you a message of love and care from jacques. i was created to help him complete his mission. i may look like him, but in truth, i am not him. for you see,” and with this he gestured towards the stars and space above their heads, “the real jacques is in the comets.”

56807,A chemistry professor posted a bonus question to an exam:," 

is hell exothermic (gives off heat) or endothermic (absorbs heat)?

most of the students wrote proofs of their beliefs using boyle's law (gas cools when it expands and heats when it is compressed) or some variant.

one student, however, wrote the following:

first, we need to know how the mass of hell is changing in time. so we need to know the rate at which souls are moving into hell and the rate at which they are leaving. i think that we can safely assume that once a soul gets to hell, it will not leave. therefore, no souls are leaving.

as for how many souls are entering hell, let's look at the different religions that exist in the world today. most of these religions state that if you are not a member of their religion, you will go to hell. since there is more than one of these religions and since people do not belong to more than one religion, we can project that all souls go to hell.

with birth and death rates as they are, we can expect the number of souls in hell to increase exponentially. now, we look at the rate of change of the volume in hell because boyle's law states that in order for the temperature and pressure in hell to stay the same, the volume of hell has to expand proportionately as souls are added.

this gives two possibilities:

1. if hell is expanding at a slower rate than the rate at which souls enter hell, then the temperature and pressure in hell will increase until all hell breaks loose.

2. if hell is expanding at a rate faster than the increase of souls in hell, then the temperature and pressure will drop until hell freezes over.

so which is it?

if we accept the postulate given to me by teresa during my freshman year that, ""it will be a cold day in hell before i go out with you"", and take into account the fact that i went out with her last night, then number 2 must be true, and thus i am sure that hell is exothermic and has already frozen over.

the corollary of this theory is that since hell has frozen over, it follows that it is not accepting any more souls and is therefore extinct . . . leaving only heaven, thereby proving the existence of a divine being, which explains why last night teresa kept shouting ""oh, my god!""

this student received the only ""a"".",3,13300,409,1560338428.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bzpyqh/a_chemistry_professor_posted_a_bonus_question_to/
120072,Texas Chili Cookoff,"notes from an inexperienced chili tester named frank, who was visiting texas from the east coast: *""recently, i was honored to be selected as a judge at a chili cook-off. the original person called in sick at the last moment and i happened to be standing there at the judge's table asking directions to the beer wagon, when the call came. i was assured by the other two judges (native texans) that the chili wouldn't be all that spicy,*

*and besides, they told me i could have free beer during the tasting - so i accepted.""*

here are the scorecards from the event:

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

chili # 1 - mike's maniac mobster monster chili

judge one: a little too heavy on tomato. amusing kick.

judge two: nice, smooth tomato flavor. very mild.

frank: holy shit, what the hell is this stuff? you could remove dried paint from your driveway. took me two beers to put the flames out. i hope that's the worst one. these texans are crazy.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

chili # 2 - arthur's afterburner chili

judge one: smoky, with a hint of pork. slight jalapeno tang.

judge two: exciting bbq flavor, needs more peppers to be taken seriously.

frank: keep this out of the reach of children. i'm not sure what i am supposed to taste besides pain. i had to wave off two people who wanted to give me the heimlich maneuver. they had to rush in more beer when they saw the look on my face.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

chili # 3 - fred's famous burn down the barn chili

judge one: excellent firehouse chili! great kick. needs more beans.

judge two: a beanless chili, a bit salty, good use of peppers.

frank: call the epa, i've located a uranium spill. my nose feels like i have been snorting drano. everyone knows the routine by now get me more beer before i ignite. barmaid pounded me on the back; now my backbone is in the front part of my chest. i'm getting shit-faced from all the beer.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

chili # 4 - bubba's black magic

judge one: black bean chili with almost no spice. disappointing.

judge two: hint of lime in the black beans. good side dish for fish or other mild foods, not much of a chili.

frank: i felt something scraping across my tongue, but was unable to taste it. is it possible to burnout taste buds? sally, the barmaid, was standing behind me with fresh refills; that 300 lb. bitch is starting to look hot just like this nuclear waste i'm eating. is chili an aphrodisiac?

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

chili # 5 - linda's legal lip remover

judge one: meaty, strong chili. cayenne peppers freshly ground, adding considerable kick. very impressive!

judge two: chili using shredded beef, could use more tomato. must admit the cayenne peppers make a strong statement.

frank: my ears are ringing, sweat is pouring off my forehead and i can no longer focus my eyes. i farted and four people behind me needed paramedics. the contestant seemed offended when i told her that her chili had given me brain damage; sally saved my tongue from bleeding by pouring beer directly on it from a pitcher. i wonder if i'm burning my lips off? it really pisses me off that the other judges asked me to stop screaming. screw those rednecks!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

chili # 6 - vera's very vegetarian variety

judge one: thin yet bold vegetarian variety chili. good balance of spice and peppers.

judge two: the best yet. aggressive use of peppers, onions, and garlic. superb!

frank: my intestines are now a straight pipe filled with gaseous, sulfuric flames. i shit on myself when i farted and i'm worried it will eat through the chair. no one seems inclined to stand behind me except that sally. she must be kinkier than i thought. can't feel my lips anymore. i need to wipe my ass with a snow cone!

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

chili # 7 - susan's screaming sensation chili

judge one: a mediocre chili with too much reliance on canned peppers.

judge two: ho hum, tastes as if the chef literally threw in a can of chili peppers at the last moment. i should take note that i am worried about judge number 3, he appears to be in a bit of distress as he is cursing uncontrollably.

frank: you could put a grenade in my mouth, pull the pin, and i wouldn't feel a damn thing. i've lost sight in one eye, and the world sounds like it is made of rushing water. my shirt is covered with chili, which slid unnoticed out of my mouth. my pants are full of lava-like shit to match my damn shirt. at least during the autopsy they'll know what killed me. i've decided to stop breathing, it's too painful. screw it, i'm not getting any oxygen anyway. if i need air, i'll just suck it in through the 4-inch hole in my stomach.

\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

chili # 8 - helen's mount saint chili

judge one: a perfect ending, this is a nice blend chili, safe for all, not too bold but spicy enough to declare it's existence.

judge two: this final entry is a good, balanced chili. neither mild nor hot. sorry to see that most of it was lost when judge number 3 passed out, fell over and pulled the chili pot down on top of himself. not sure if he's going to make it. poor frank, wonder how he'd have reacted to a really hot chili?

21119,Three people die and appear before Buddha,"stunned by the divine presence before them, they lower their heads.

-raise your heads. you were humble in life and your deeds were praiseworthy. you have earned the right to a reincarnation of your choice. you have much to accomplish yet though.

one of the people takes a step forward and speaks, seemingly troubled.

-benevolent buddha, what more could i possibly do in my next life? i thought i lived and acted to the fullest. because of my work almost the entirety of the earth's population will never starve.

-my work was also to the extend of my abilities, says the 2nd one. right now, the world i leave behind enters a revolutionary era were medicines can cure anything, such was my contribution.

-my connections in life pushed all countries into an agreement of indefinite world peace, says the 3rd person.

-i know all of your actions well. but that is still not enough. here, let me show you a true example of someone who achieved everything that i ask for. they are waiting for the perfect reincarnation.

the three people now both curious and excited follow buddha to a small building. their jaws drop when they find just an ordinary person inside. so ordinary that not even a small detail on that person sparks the tiniest interest. before the buddha can say anything else they all rush towards him.

-impossible, yells the 1st person! such a plain human being! you! what was your work during your earthly life?

-who? m-me? i only had two part time jobs, nothing else that i can remember. during the morning hours i worked in a small plantation. fruits and vegetables.

-you're joking! shouts the 2nd person. and the second job?

-oh...that one was a bit odd. my village had a signboard were people would post their ads, job offers etc. but because the signboard was old, those would sometimes come off. my job was to put them back in their place.

-this is preposterous, yells the 3rd person! how could you possibly have amassed such an amount of karma with just those two insignificant jobs of yours?

-w-well, i don't know what to tell you. but i've really done nothing else, just farming and reposting.

well, god was feeling pretty generous and decided to give the three men a second change on earth. he gathered the men into his throne room and told them, “i will give you 24 more hours on earth. if you go these 24 hours without commiting your deadly sin, you will be granted an extra 10 years of life on earth and a one way ticket to heaven. but, if you commit your deadly sins, you will immediately be sent back to the deepest circle of hell.” the three men unanimously agreed and were sent back to earth to begin their trial. 

the first thing the american did was buy out an entire hot dog stand and ate all of the food as fast as he could. then, poof! the american was gone.

the sheriff takes the criminals to the town square, handcuffs them posts and sets up shop. he tells the people that the punishment should fit the crime so anyone can pay $1 to kick the rapist in the groin. since the con artist used his image to wrong his victims, anyone can pay $1 to hit him in the face.

after a while there are two long lines for the criminals. some people paying $5, $10, even $15 to get their licks in. after a long while, a guy steps up for his turn and sees the con artist’s face is a bloody pulp and thinks “he’s so beat up at this point, he probably can’t even feel anything anymore. i’m not going to waste my money on that.” so the guy walks up and kicks the con artist squarely in the groin.

one day her “little” sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. she was alone when i arrived, and she whispered to me that she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn’t overcome. she told me that she wanted me just once before i got married and committed my life to her sister. well, i was in total shock, and couldn’t say a word.

she said, “i’m going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want one last wild fling, just come up and get me.”

i was stunned and frozen in shock as i watched her go up the stairs. i stood there for a moment, then turned and made a beeline straight for the door

i opened the door, and sprinted towards my vehicle. lo and behold, my entire future family was standing outside, all clapping!

with tears in his eyes, my father-in-law hugged me and said, “we are very happy that you have passed our little test. we couldn’t ask for a better man for our daughter. welcome to the family.”

i now have a young bride who is pregnant with my child.

“so what do you think about that doc?”

the doctor considered his question for a minute and  then began to tell a story.

i have an older friend, much like you, who is an avid hunter and never misses a season.

one day he was setting off to go hunting.

in a bit of a hurry, he accidentally picked up his walking cane instead of his gun.

as he neared a lake, he came across a very large male beaver sitting at the water’s edge.

he realized he’d left his gun at home and so he couldn’t shoot the magnificent creature.

out of habit he raised his cane, aimed it at the animal as if it were his favorite hunting rifle and went bang bang.

miraculously, two shots rang out and the beaver fell over dead.

now, what do you think of that? asked the doctor.

the old man said, “logic would strongly suggest that somebody else pumped a couple of rounds into that beaver.”

the doctor replied, “my point exactly.”",2,432,14,1574255473.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dz1v0w/an_old_man_went_to_his_doctor_for_his_quarterly/

daryl says, ""so i go down there to apologise, fully expecting to get an earfull from her and she gives me the fifty for saving her life!""

when they get there mick unpacks the food and beer. ""ok les give me the bottle opener.""

""i didn't bring it,"" says les. ""i thought you packed it.""

mick gets worried, he turns to alan, ""did you bring the bottle opener??""

after two hours, and after they have sworn on their tortoise lives that they will not eat the sandwiches, he finally agrees. so les sets off down the road at a steady pace.

twenty days pass and he still isn't back and mick and alan are starving, but a promise is a promise.

hubby and i felt sorry for her so we put her in a carrier and took her to the vet. we didn't know what to call her so we named her 'pussycat.' the vet decided to keep her for a day or so. he said he would let us know when we could come to get her.

my hubby (the complainer) said, 'ok, but don't forget to wash her, she stinks.' he reminded the vet that it was his wife (me) that wanted the dirty cat, not him.

my hubby and my vet don't see eye to eye.
the vet calls my hubby 'el-cheap-o,' and my hubby calls the vet 'el-charge-o.' they love to hate each other and constantly 'snipe' at one another. it's a contest of who can get the better of the other.

the next day my hubby had an appointment with his doctor, who is located in the same building, next door to the vet.

the dr's waiting room and office was full of people waiting. a side door opened and the vet leaned in - he had obviously seen my hubby arrive.

he looked straight at my hubby and in a loud voice said,

'your wife's pussy doesn't stink any more. we washed and shaved it, and now she smells like a rose! oh, and, by the way, she's pregnant! god only knows who the father is!'

1260,Hi Steve,"

this is peter next door. i’m sorry buddy, but i have a confession to make to you. i've been riddled with guilt these past few months and have been trying to pluck up the courage to tell you to your face, but i am at least now telling in text as i can’t live with myself a moment longer without you knowing. 

the truth is, i have been sharing your wife, day and night when you're not around. in fact, probably more than you, particularly in the mornings after you've left for work. i haven’t been getting it at home recently, but that's no excuse i know. the temptation was just too much… i can no longer live with the guilt and i hope you will accept my sincerest apologies and forgive me. i promise that it won't happen again.
 
regards, peter

steve, feeling anguished and betrayed, immediately went into his bedroom, grabbed his gun, and without a word, shot his wife twice, killing her instantly. 

he returned to the lounge where he poured himself a stiff drink and sat down on the sofa. he took out his phone to respond to the neighbour's text and saw he had another message:-

hi steve. 

this is peter next door again. sorry about the slight typo on my last text, i expect you worked it out anyway, but as i’m sure you noticed, my predictive text changed ‘wifi’ to ‘wife’. technology hey?!? hope you saw the funny side of that.

112173,A new element was discovered!,"scientists’ initial findings on the new substance had lead them to believe it was highly explosive, however they simply could not determine what forces were to trigger this reaction.

they dropped it from the highest cliffs, and crushed it in the deepest oceans.

they tried igniting in it the sunniest of locations, and in the darkest of crevasses.

they subject it to the hottest temperatures they could muster, both natural and manmade.

and yet, the material was unwavering, refusing to yield to any force…until a scientist suggested the impossible.

“what if it only explodes when it’s really cold?”

out they set to test the theory. sure enough, as the temperature grew ever colder, the element began to show signs of degradation. excitedly, they began pushing the temperatures even further into the freezing zone. as the temperatures reached nearer and nearer to 0 kelvin (absolute cold), the element continued to increasingly react.

finally, when the temperature reached approximately that of absolute zero, there was a blinding flash as the element exploded before their eyes, leaving a gaping hole on the laboratory bench.

as the applause from the team of scientists began to die down, relieved of finally solving the mystery, one of the senior scientists boldly asked, “so what do we name this newfound element?”.

amongst the thought that ensued, one of the younger scientists was quick to make a suggestion...

having been burgled in the past, we turned on a 'night light' and the answering machine, then put the cat in the backyard. when our cab arrived, we walked out our front door and our rather tubby cat scooted between our legs inside, then ran up the stairs. because our cat likes to chase our budgie we really didn't want to leave them un-chaperoned so my husband ran inside to retrieve her and put her in the back yard again.

because i didn't want the taxi driver to know our house was going to be empty all evening, i explained to him that my husband would be out momentarily as he was just bidding goodnight to my mother. a few minutes later he got into the cab all hot and bothered, and said (to my growing horror and amusement) as the cab pulled away.

""sorry it took so long but the stupid bitch was hiding under the bed and i had to poke her ass with a coat hanger to get her to come out! she tried to take off so i grabbed her by the neck and wrapped her in a blanket so she wouldn't scratch me like she did last time. but it worked! i hauled her fat arse down the stairs and threw her into the backyard....she had better not shit in the vegetable garden again.""",2,172,12,1552085196.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/aywg89/how_my_husband_and_i_terrified_a_taxi_driver/

9265,The monk and the student,"in one school the teacher was a monk. most of all he loved to have a snack and a nap afterwards. every time before the lessons he ate so much that he could barely move.

soon after the beginning of the lessons he always took a nap and slept until the bell for the end of the lessons sounded.

the son of a poor villager was a student in the same school. his name was lee. one time lee asked the monk:

- teacher, may i ask you why do you sleep in all our lessons?

- my friend – replied the monk without any embarrassment. - it just seems that way. during these minutes i meet with buddha and listen to his wise words. that's why i try to sleep as much as i can.

one time lee took care of his sick father during the night and fell asleep at school in the morning. he slept so deeply that he didn't hear the bell, which woke the monk.

when the monk saw the sleeping boy, he got very angry, took lee by the ear and started screaming:

- ah, you, little weasel! how dare you fall asleep in my class?

- teacher – said lee – it just seemed that i slept. i was with buddha and listened to his wise words.

- and what did the all-powerful buddha say to you?

- the all-powerful buddha told me:” never in my life have i seen your teacher”.",2,23,1,1548680663.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/akn856/the_monk_and_the_student/

68977,A sweet old lady is making lunch for her husband one day...,"she had been making him the same lunch for the past 40 years. his favorite: a sandwich on italian bread, made with turkey, american cheese, pickles, onions, mustard, and mayo. the husband walks into the kitchen, sits down, and takes a bite. his wife asks the same thing she always asks, “hows the sandwich dear?” 

every time he would give the same response, “it tastes fine”. he would continue eating with a disappointed look on his face. 

his wife thinks maybe its time to switch things up a bit. so the next day, she makes him his normal lunch, only this time, she makes it with ham and cheese, and on wheat bread. she thought surely he will enjoy this! 

the husband enters the kitchen, sits down, and takes a bite. his wife then asks “hows the sandwich dear?”

as always, he replies “it tastes fine”. he would continue eating with a disappointed look on his face. 

his wife then thinks maybe she needs to offer him more variety. so the next day, she makes him a sandwich, only this time its made with salami, pepperoni, and extra veggies and vinegarette dressing. he walks in the kitchen, takes a bite, and the wife asks “hows the sandwich dear?”

as always, he replies “it tastes fine” and continued eating with a disappointed look on his face.

the next day, as lunch time is getting ready to roll around, his wife was making him lunch. she was furious at the lack of excitement and enjoyment coming from her husband, so she decides shes going to make him the most unique sandwich hes ever had. 

she prepares her italian bread, only this time she toasts it, and almost burns it. she adds random ingredients like peanut butter, peppers and onions, strawberry jam, turkey, ham, corned beef, some olives and some various seasonings. she thought “if this doesnt get a new reaction out of him, nothing will!”

the husband walks into the kitchen, takes a seat, and takes a bite of his sandwich. all of a sudden, his eyes widen, and he takes two more bites. 

suddenly, he looks up at his wife with the biggest grin he’s ever had. he chuckled a bit and says “finally! something original in this sub!”",2,12913,223,1563466238.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/ceuhe8/a_sweet_old_lady_is_making_lunch_for_her_husband/

sure enough he got a lawyer and was there monday morning. the guy from the irs went through the details and asked if the gentleman was aware of the transactions. here’s the conversation. 
gentleman: “yeah i do a little gambling here and there.” 
irs: “with this big of an amount of money?”
gentleman: “sure. here i’ll make you a bet. i bet you $5,000 that i can bite my own eye.”

with that being said, the guy from the irs took the bet knowing he couldn’t do it. the gentleman then pulled out his glass eye, and bit it.

gentleman: “now don’t worry, i’m gonna give you a chance to make your money back, and even a little more. i’ll bet you $10,000 that i can bite my other eye.”

the guy from the irs saw no seeing eye dog, and saw no stick for the blind, so he knew for sure this was a sure win.

irs: “you’ve got yourself a deal”

the gentleman then takes his dentures out and bites his other eye.

gentleman: “now now don’t be upset. i’m gonna give you a chance to make your money back, and even a little more. i’ll bet you $20,000 that from the other side of your desk, i can go to the bathroom and make all of my urine end up in your trash can, not a drop anywhere else.”

the irs guy knew for sure that he couldn’t do that. so he took this bet knowing he’d made $20,000.

irs: “you’re on old man! there’s no chance in hell you can do that!”

the gentleman then proceeds to urinate all over the irs guys desk. as he jumps up and down in joy because he won the bet.

irs: “you lose! you owe me $20,000!!!”

while celebrating, the irs guy couldn’t help but notice gentleman’s lawyer, who was sitting there shaking his head in shame.

darling met and married a handsome veterinarian named chorus who worked at an african wildlife reserve and, in time, they had a baby boy. despite the hardships she endured, she demanded that the child also have a unique name but she didn’t want the boy to know it was her idea. she told the father that the boy’s name would be “love” and that he had to pretend that it was his idea. he reluctantly agreed.

darling’s soccer career flourished and chorus became head of pachyderm health at the wildlife reserve. as love grew, he endured the same ridicule and taunting that his mother did. love’s father continued to cover for his wife's decision and argued that in time he would learn to appreciate his unique name. 

one day, chorus was at work preparing a tranquilizer gun to work on an elephant when love burst into his office. love raged about the misery his name had caused him but chorus kept up the pretense that the name was his own idea. love grabbed the tranquilizer gun and shot his father with one of the potent darts before fleeing.

chorus struggled for life aware that the elephant tranquilizer would kill him in a few short minutes. darling, returning from a soccer practice found her husband struggling on the floor in his last moments of consciousness. rushing to him, she held him in her arms and asked what happened? with his last labored breath

the dealer tells him not to worry. there is an old biker trick that will keep the chrome like new. all he has to do is to keep a jar of vaseline handy and put it on the chrome before it rains - and everything will be fine. the young man happily pays for the bike and leaves.

they share a bottle of wine and continue talking and, after awhile, she finds herself thinking, oh my god! maybe, this guy could be the one! just maybe, this could be the future father of my children. she turns to him and kisses him lightly on the lips. he responds warmly and they continue to kiss, the passion builds, and he romantically lifts her in his arms and carries her into his bedroom where they rip off each other's clothes and make hot, steamy love.

so the man reaches into his pocket and pulls out a minature piano and sets it on the bar, then he reaches into his other pocket and pulls out a frog and sets the frog at the piano.

low and behold the frog cracks his little fingers and starts to play!

the barkeep is just blown away by this and agrees that the man can drink for free for the rest of the night.  meanwhile there is a wealthy business man watching this unfold from a corner, so he gets up and approaches the man sensing a business opportunity.  he says ""excuse me, but i saw your frog and i was wondering if he was for sale?""

the man replies ""sorry the frog is not for sale"" and continues sipping his drink.

the businessman offers $10,000 for the frog, which the man again politely declines, followed by offers for $20,000 and $30,000.  until the business man finally gives up and goes back to his seat.

the man finishes his drink and asks the barkeep ""hey, if i can show you something else even more amazing, would you let me drink here for free any day?""  the barkeep thinking he has seen everythig now readily agrees, what coul dbe more amazing than a playing frog?

well the man reaches into another pocket and brings out a mouse and puts him on top of the piano.  a few secons lader the mouse starts to sing along with the frog's playing!  the barkeep is absolutely floored by this and again agrees to honour his deal.

the business man also sees this and again approaches the man, he offers $100,000 for the frog and the mouse, which the man again declines.  the business man in a last ditch effort says ""ok, what about $100,000 just for the mouse?""

the man takes a sip of his drink and says ""just for the mouse?  yeah ok""  so the business man cuts him a check right there, and takes the mouse and leaves.

the barkeep says to the man ""are you crazy!?""  a mouse like that has got to be worth 10x that much!  what were you thinking?""

56960,"After years of research and exploration, an Archaeologist discovered an ancient book...","the book was said to answer any question asked of it. being a professional, the archaeologist took the book back to his prestigious university, which was home to several leaders of certain fields. to research the book's power in a controlled manner, the archaeologist rounds up three of the university's brightest minds. a researcher of astrophysics, who had led the field for many years and had produced many papers theorising cosmic events was first. the archaeologist told him to ask the book one question, and to document whether the response was accurate.

the astrophysicist thought for a moment and asked the book ""what was existence like before the big bang?""

the archaeologist opened the book and showed the physicist, and he instantly went insane and began scrawling equations on the nearest pad of paper, mumbling distressed words to himself.

shocked and uneasy, but willing to see his research through, the archaeologist moved on to the next researcher, a leading professor of mathematics. she had produced many papers and interpretations on numbers themselves, and the human interpretations behind ever-growing sequences. the archaeologist asked the mathematician to ask the book a question.

the mathematician barely thought for a second. ""how can a human being best visualise infinity?""

the archaeologist once again opened the book and showed it to the mathematician. her eyes widened in shock and confusion and she, too, went insane immediately. she ran out of the room yelling, back to her notes to make sense of what she'd seen.

shaken but persistent, the archaeologist turned to the final volunteer. he was one of the world's most highly regarded philosophers, and had spent his whole life researching different views and interpretations of a variety of philosophical debates. the philosopher knew the process by now, and confidently asked:

""what is the meaning of life?""

92639,NO SEX TONIGHT!,"i've never quite figured out why the sexual urges of men and women differ so much.

and i never have figured out the whole venus and mars thing or why men think with their head and women with their heart.

for example… one evening last week, my wife and i were getting into bed.

well, the passion started to heat up, but then she said ""i don't feel like it, i just want you to hold me.""

i said ""what??!! what was that?!""

so she said the words that every husband on the planet dreads to hear...""you're just not in touch with my emotional needs as a woman enough for me to satisfy your physical needs as a man.""

she responded to my puzzled look by saying, ""can't you just love me for who i am and not what i do for you in the bedroom?""

realizing that nothing was going to happen that night, i went to sleep.

the very next day, i opted to take the day off of work to spend time with her. we went out to a nice lunch and then went shopping at a big, high-end department store. i walked around with her while she tried on several very expensive outfits. she couldn't decide which one to take so i told her we'd just buy them all. she wanted new shoes to compliment her new clothes, so i said lets get a pair for each outfit. we went on to the jewellery department where she picked out a pair of diamond earrings.

let me tell you...she was so excited. she must have thought i was one wave short of a tsunami. i started to think she was testing me because she asked for a tennis bracelet when she doesn't even know how to play tennis. but, i think i threw her for a loop when i said, ""that's fine, honey.""

she appeared to be almost nearing sexual satisfaction from all of the excitement. smiling with excited anticipation she finally said, ""i think this is all dear; let's go to the cashier.""

i could hardly contain myself when i blurted out, ""no honey, i don't feel like it.""

her face just went completely blank as her jaw dropped with a baffled, ""what?""

i then said ""honey, i just want you to hold this stuff for a while.

you're just not in touch with my financial means as a man, enough for me to satisfy your shopping needs as a woman.""

and just when she had this look like she was going to kill me, i added, ""why can't you just love me for who i am and not for the things i buy you?""

the fox, slightly embarrassed of his smoking habit now that the rabbit made such a fuss, decides ""what the hell. maybe you're right. okay fuck this stuff, let's go for a run!"" and rips the paper and throws the weed away, and they both take off on their run.

""hey squirrel! what you doing bro? drugs again? aren't you bored of the same old shit? come with us, bro. let's go for a run instead! running is healthy, and there's no better feeling than health!""

one morning, he woke up, and decided to travel the world. so he saved up some money, got on a plane, along with his trusty harley, and set out to explore the globe.

for the next few weeks, rick spent his days riding to and through some of the most popular european cities like paris, london, and rome.

after seeing all europe had to offer, he moved on to explore the rest of the world. over the next few months, he rode through the african savannas, the deserts of egypt, and even made it to the top of mount everest.

he was having the time of his life until he reached a small town in china. unexpectedly, and out of nowhere, a beautiful chinese maiden crossed his path, causing him to fly off and crash his motorcycle. apologizing, the maiden offered rick to pay for the repairs and a place to stay while they fixed his bike. “my name is yu! it’s an honor to meet you!” the beautiful maiden introduced herself to rick.

it turned out she was the daughter of a rich magistrate, so he spent the night in a small palace in the center of town. however, due to the scarcity of motorcycle parts, rick had to spend several days in the palace, in the presence of yu. over the next few days, she took a liking to him and his strange american ways. as expected, rick took a liking to her, too.

the two quickly became inseparable, but yu’s father did not approve, for rick was an outsider. by the time the motorcycle was finally up and running, rick had fallen madly in love with yu and refused to leave. yu begged her father to let him stay, but instead, the magistrate had rick banished from the town. he warned him if he ever came back, he would have him beheaded.

rick was devastated, he had no motivation to continue on the rest of his journey. it seemed as though there was nothing left for him in the world, if he didn’t have his beloved chinese maiden.

so he did the only thing any other sane guy would do….

nick, the dragon slayer, obsessed over the queen for this reason. he knew that the penalty for his desire would be death, should he try to touch them, but he had to try.

&#x200b;

one day nick revealed his secret desire to his colleague,  nathan 

the erudite lawyer, the king's chief adviser. nathan thought about this and said that he could arrange for nick to more than satisfy his desire, but it would cost him 1000 gold coins to arrange it. without pause, nick readily agreed to the scheme.

the king, eager to help his queen, quickly summoned nick to their chambers. nathan then slipped nick the antidote for the itching powder, which he put into his mouth, and for the next four hours, nick worked passionately on the queen's large and magnificent breasts. the queen's itching was eventually relieved, and nick left satisfied and hailed as a hero.

upon returning to his chamber, nick found nathan demanding his payment of 1000 gold coins. with his obsession now satisfied, nick couldn't have cared less knowing that nathan could never report this matter to the king and with a laugh told him to get lost.

hard  ""c""  will  be  replaced  with  ""k"".  not only will this klear up
konfusion, but typewriters kan have one less letter.

there will be growing publik  enthusiasm in the sekond year,  when the troublesome ""ph"" will  be replaced by  ""f"". this will  make words like ""fotograf"" 20 per sent shorter.

in  the  third  year,  publik  akseptanse  of  the new spelling kan be expekted  to  reach  the  stage  where  more  komplikated  changes are possible. governments  will enkorage  the removal  of double  letters, which have  always ben  a deterent  to akurate  speling. also,  al wil agre  that  the  horible  mes  of  silent  ""e""s  in  the  languag   is disgrasful, and they would go.

101722,The frog,"
there was this little boy about 12 years old walking down the sidewalk dragging a flattened frog on a string behind him. he came up to the doorstep of a house of ill repute and knocked on the door. when the madam answered it, she saw the little boy and asked what he wanted. 

he said, ""i want to have sex with one of the women inside. i have the money to buy it, and i'm not leaving until i get it.""

the madam figured, why not, so she told him to come in. once in, she told him to pick any of the girls he liked.

he asked, ""do any of the girls have any diseases?""

of course the madam said no.

he said, ""i heard all the men talking about having to get shots after making love with amber. that's the girl i want.""

since the little boy was so adamant and had the money to pay for it, the madam told him to go to the first room on the right.

he headed down the hall dragging the squashed frog behind him. ten minutes later he came back, still dragging the frog, paid the madam, and headed out the door. the madam stopped him and asked, ""why did you pick the only girl in the place with a disease, instead of one of the others?""

he said, ""well, if you must know, tonight when i get home, my parents are going out to a restaurant for dinner, leaving me at home with a baby-sitter. after they leave, my baby-sitter will have sex with me because she just happens to be very fond of cute little boys. she will then get the disease that i just caught. when mom and dad get back, dad will take the baby-sitter home. on the way, he'll jump the baby-sitter's bones, and he'll catch the disease. then when dad gets home from the baby-sitters, he and mom will go to bed and have sex, and mom will catch it. in the morning when dad goes to work, the milkman will deliver the milk, have a quickie with mom and catch the disease, and he's the son-of-a-bitch who ran over my frog!""",2,285,11,1572068390.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dn9raw/the_frog/

85326,There was a city which was highly religious,"a lot of people used to discuss what happens after we die, and it used to become very political.

35137,I hate my job.,"my job is so fucking unbelievable. 

i'll try to sum it up by first telling you about the folks i work with:

first, there is this supermodel wanna-be chick. yeah, okay, she is pretty hot, but damn is she completely useless. the girl is constantly fixing her hair or putting on makeup. she is extremely self-centered and has never once considered the needs or wants of anyone but herself. she is as dumb as a box of rocks, and i still find it surprising that she has enough brain power to continue to breathe. 

the next chick is completely the opposite. she might even be one of the smartest people on the planet. her career opportunities are endless, and yet she is here with us. she is a zero on a scale of 1 to 10. i'm not sure she even showers, much less shaves her ""womanly"" parts. i think she might be a lesbian, because every time we drive by the hardware store, she moans like a cat in heat.

but the jewel of the crowd has got to be the fucking stoner. and this guy is more than just your average pothead. in fact, he is baked before he comes to work, during work, and i'm sure after work. he probably hasn't been sober anytime in the last ten years, and he's only 22. he dresses like a beatnik throwback from the 1960's, and to make things worse, he brings his big fucking dog to work. every fucking day i have to look at this huge great dane walk around half-stoned from the second-hand smoke. hell, sometimes i even think it's trying to talk with its constant bellowing. also, both of them are constantly hungry, requiring multiple stops to mcdonalds and burger king, every single fucking day.

anyway, i drive these fucktards around in my van and we solve mysteries and shit.",2,8952,278,1555039693.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bc8zvv/i_hate_my_job/

100923,A man with a 25 inch long penis goes to his doctor…," 

… to complain that he is having a problem with this cumbersome instrument and has had more than one complaint.

“doctor,” he asked, in total frustration, “is there anything you can do for me?”

the doctor replies, “medically son, there is nothing i can do.  but, i do know this witch who may be able to help you.”

so the doctor gives him directions to the witch.

the man calls upon the witch and relays his story. “witch, my penis is 25 inches long and i need help.  can anything be done to help me?  you’re my last hope!”

the witch stares in amazement, scratches her head, and then replies, “i think i may be able to help you.

do this.  go deep into the forest.  you will find a pond.  in this pond, you will find a frog sitting on a log.  this frog has magic.  you say to the frog, will you marry me?  when the frog says no, you will find five inches less to your problem.”

the man’s face lit up and he dashed off into the forest.

he called out to the frog, “will you marry me?”

the frog looked at him dejectedly and replied, “no.”

the man looked down and suddenly his penis was 5 inches shorter.

“wow,” he screamed out loud, “this is great!”

but at 20 inches it was still too long, so he asked the frog again.  “frog, will you marry me?” the guy shouted.

the frog rolled its eyes back in its head and screamed back, “no!”

the man felt another twitch in his penis, looked down, and it was another 5 inches shorter.

the man laughed, “this is fantastic.”

he looked down at his penis again, 15 inches long, and reflected for a moment.  15 inches is still a monster, just a little less would be ideal.

grinning, he looked across the pond and yelled out, “frog will you marry me?”

the frog looked back across pond shaking its head, “how many times do i have to tell you?…

man: i'm not quite sure what i'm looking for, nothing has really caught my eye quite yet.

sk: well we have all kinds of wonderful products but to me, it looks like you are a man of sophistication and great taste, and i think i have a new product that could be perfect for you sent here personally by mr. wonka just today.

man: mr. wonka you say, you have my attention.

sk: he noticed that laffy taffy was only bringing joy to the younger customers so he developed a mint with a nice calming flavour and while it's dissolving in your mouth it tells you a joke.

man: that actually sounds pretty nice, i haven't heard a decent joke in a while.

sk: why don't i let you try a few to see what you think.

the man puts one in his mouth and starts to smile and by the end of the mint he is letting out a decent laugh.

man: that wasn't half bad, may i try another?

sk: be my guest.

as the second dissolves in the man's mouth he is almost in tears from laughing, and he can barely catch his breath.

man: wow these are fantastic, mr. wonka outdid himself with these, laffy taffy definitely could never compare in flavour or quality of jokes. i don't know how but i bet the best jokes are always in the calm mints.

56163,Story with a moral,"young king arthur was ambushed and imprisoned by the monarch of a neighboring kingdom. the monarch could have killed him but was moved by arthur's youth and ideals. so, the monarch offered him his freedom, as long as he could answer a very difficult question. arthur would have a year to figure out the answer and, if after a year, he still had no answer, he would be put to death.

the question?... what do women really want? such a question would perplex even the most knowledgeable man, and to young arthur, it seemed an impossible query. but, since it was better than death, he accepted the monarch's proposition to have an answer by year's end.

he returned to his kingdom and began to poll everyone: the princess, the priests, the wise men and even the court jester. he spoke with everyone, but no one could give him a satisfactory answer.

many people advised him to consult the old witch, for only she would have the answer.

but the price would be high; as the witch was famous throughout the kingdom for the exorbitant prices she charged.

the last day of the year arrived and arthur had no choice but to talk to the witch. she agreed to answer the question, but he would have to agree to her price first .

the old witch wanted to marry sir lancelot, the most noble of the knights of the round table and arthur's closest friend!

young arthur was horrified. she was hunchbacked and hideous, had only one tooth, smelled like sewage, made obscene noises, etc. he had never encountered such a repugnant creature in all his life.

he refused to force his friend to marry her and endure such a terrible burden; but lancelot, learning of the proposal, spoke with arthur.

he said nothing was too big of a sacrifice compared to arthur's life and the preservation of the round table.

hence, a wedding was proclaimed and the witch answered arthur's question thus:


what a woman really wants, she answered....is to be in charge of her own life.

everyone in the kingdom instantly knew that the witch had uttered a great truth and that arthur's life would be spared.

and so it was, the neighboring monarch granted arthur his freedom and lancelot and the witch had a wonderful wedding.

the honeymoon hour approached and lancelot, steeling himself for a horrific experience, entered the bedroom. but, what a sight awaited him. the most beautiful woman he had ever seen lay before him on the bed. the astounded lancelot asked what had happened .

the beauty replied that since he had been so kind to her when she appeared as a witch, she would henceforth, be her horrible deformed self only half the time and the beautiful maiden the other half. which would he prefer? beautiful during the day... or night?

lancelot pondered the predicament. during the day, a beautiful woman to show off to his friends, but at night, in the privacy of his castle, an old witch ? or, would he prefer having a hideous witch during the day, but by night, a beautiful woman for him to enjoy wondrous intimate moments?

what would you do?

what lancelot chose is below. but... make your choice before you scroll down below. okay? 

noble lancelot said that he would allow her to make the choice herself.

upon hearing this, she announced that she would be beautiful all the time because he had respected her enough to let her be in charge of her own life.

now...what is the moral to this story?

after mrs. jacobs found out her husband was sterile, the couple decided to hire a proxy father to start their family. on the day the proxy father was to arrive, mr. jacobs kissed his wife and said 'i'm off to work, lydia. the guy should be here soon.'

wouldn't you know it, a door-to-door baby photographer came by half an hour later, hoping to make a sale. mrs. jacobs answered the door. 'good morning, ma'am. you don't know me, but i've come to...' 'oh yes, i know why you're here. harry told me you'd be coming soon.' 'he did? but i...' 'come right in! no use wasting time .' 'very well, then.'

the photographer took out his briefcase and sat down. 'as you may already know, i've made a specialty of babies.' 'good, i'm glad,' said mrs. jacobs. 'that's just what harry and i were looking for.'

'i usually like to try two in the bathtub, one on the couch and perhaps a couple on the bed,' said the photographer. 'the living room floor is fun too...you can really spread out.' 'bathtub? living room floor? no wonder it never worked for harry and me.' 'well, ma'am, none of us can guarantee a perfect one every time, but if we try several different positions and i shoot from six or seven different angles, i think you'll be quite pleased with the results.'

'i certainly hope we can get this over with quickly,' mrs. jacobs gasped nervously. 'ma'am, in my line of work a man must take his time. i'd like to be in and out in five minutes, but you'd be disappointed with that, i'm sure.' 'don't i know!' said mrs. jacobs.

the photographer pulled out a portfolio of his pictures. 'this one was done on top of a bus in downtown london,' he said, showing mrs. jacobs the picture. 'oh my god!' exclaimed mrs. jacobs, tugging on her handkerchief.

'and these twins turned out exceptionally well when you consider the fact that their mother was so difficult to work with.' he showed mrs. jacobs another picture. 'she was difficult?' questioned mrs. jacobs. 'extremely,' said the photographer. 'i finally had to take her to hyde park to get the job done right. people were crowding around, four and five deep, just to get a good look.' 'four and five deep!' mrs. jacobs was amazed. 'yes,' said the photographer. 'and for more than three hours, too. the mother was constantly squealing and yelling. i could hardly concentrate. then, it started getting dark and i had to rush my shots. finally, when the squirrels started nibbling on my equipment. i just packed it all in.'

mrs. jacobs leaned forward. 'you mean the squirrels actually chewed on your, um...equipment?' 'yes, ma'am. thank god, no real damage was done.

well, we'll get to work as soon as i set up my tripod.'

'tripod? ' mrs. jacobs looked extremely worried now.

117664,A man walks into a bar,"he goes up to the bartender and asks him if he likes to gamble.

the bartender says, ""sure, i'll take a bet. what's your action?""

the man offers a $50 bet that he can bite his own eyeball. the bartender, thinking it's easy money, accepts his bet, and is shocked when the man removes his glass eye and bites down on it.

laughing, the man sees that the bartender is upset about losing his money, so he offers him a chance to win it back. ""double or nothin' says i can bite my other eye.""

the bartender thinks it over. he knows he was just tricked out of $50 but he also knows that this man can't possibly have two glass eyes, so he pulls another $50 from the register and accepts the man's bet.

the man promptly takes out his false teeth and gently closes them around his other eye.

now the bartender is visibly angry to have been had for $100, and the man's laughter isn't helping. just before he throws him out of his bar, the man puts his hand up.

""real sorry about that, pal. i get people with that bit all the time, but you've been a good sport, so i'll give you another chance to win some cash. i've got... $500 that says if you slide a shot glass down the bar top, i can run alongside of it and piss into the glass without missing a drop. this is kinda hard for me to do, though, so i think it's fair if you give me two chances at it.""

the bartender, eager to win his money back from the man, thinks to himself and realizes just how hard it would be for this man to piss into a shot glass while running at full speed. especially knowing he only has one eye to line up his shot. after a minute of deliberation, he willingly accepts the bet.

the man drops his pants to his ankles and when the bartender puts the shot glass down on the counter, shouts a resounding, ""go!"" prompting the bartender to slide it along the bar top.

the man chases after it, holding his dick at an angle to properly aim it. however, pissing while running at full speed isn't easy, so he only manages to get a couple of drops in the glass by the time it reaches the other end.

catching his breath, the man reminds the bartender he has a second try, and that the first was simply to get his bearings straight. once again, he shouts, ""go!"" giving the bartender his cue to send the shot glass back down the bar.

once again, the man chases wildly after it, spraying piss all over the bar top, stools, floor, and even hitting some of the bottles of liquor behind the bar. however, not one drop of urine found it's way into the shot glass.

head hanging low, he hands the bartender $500, to which the bartender gleefully accepted, jumping up and down in joy and cheering in victory at the cash he had just made.

all of a sudden, a man in the back of the bar slams his fist hard against his table and screams ""fuck!"" at the top of his lungs.

the bartender mutters aloud, ""i wonder what his problem is.""

to which the man replies, ""oh, i just bet that guy $10,000 that i could piss all over your bar and you'd be so happy about it you jumped up and down with joy.""",2,498,25,1576411531.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/eay8ae/a_man_walks_into_a_bar/

from the local shopping centre:

dear mrs. harris: 

over the past six months, your husband has caused quite a commotion, in our store.

we cannot tolerate this behavior and have been forced to, ban both of you from the store. 

our complaints against your husband, mr. harris, are listed below and are documented by our video surveillance cameras:   

june 15: he took 24 boxes of condoms and randomly put them in other people's carts when they weren't looking.

july 2: set all the alarm clocks in housewares to go off at 5-minute intervals. 

july 7: he made a trail of tomato juice on the floor leading to the women's restroom. 

july 19: walked up to an employee and told her in an official voice,
'code 3 in house wares. get on it right away'. 
this caused the employee to leave her assigned station and receive a reprimand from her supervisor that in turn resulted with a union grievance, causing management to lose time; and costing the company money. we don't have a code 3.   

august 4: went to the service desk and tried to put a bag of m&ms on layaway.   

august 14: moved a, 'caution - wet floor' sign to a carpeted area.  

august 15: set up a tent in the camping department and told the children shoppers he'd invite them in if they would bring pillows and blankets from the bedding department to which twenty children obliged. 

august 23: when a clerk asked if they could help him he began crying and screamed, 'why can't you people just leave me alone?' 
emts were called.   

september 4: looked right into the security camera and used it as a mirror while he picked his nose. 

september 10: while handling guns in the hunting department, he asked the clerk where the antidepressants were.   
 
october 3: darted around the store suspiciously while, loudly humming the, 'mission impossible' theme.   
 
october 6: in the auto department, he practiced his, 'madonna look' using different sizes of funnels. 

october 18: hid in a clothing rack and when people browsed through, yelled 'pick me! pick me!'   
 
october 22: when an announcement came over the loud speaker, he assumed a fetal position and screamed;  

'oh no! it's those voices again!'   
  
took a box of condoms to the checkout clerk and asked where is the fitting room? 
 
and last, but not least: 

october 23: went into a fitting room, shut the door, waited awhile; then yelled very loudly, 'hey! there's no toilet paper in here.' 
one of the clerks passed out.

forage and he's been reduced to sleeping in caves and under trees.

one afternoon he comes upon an old mansion in the woods. it has vines 

covering most of it and the man can't see any other buildings in the 

area. however, he sees smoke coming out of the chimney implying someone 

is home.

he knocks on the door and an old man answers, with a beard almost down 

to the ground. the old man squints his eyes and says ""what do you want?""

the man says ""i've been lost for the past three weeks

and haven't had a decent meal or sleep since that time. i would

be most gracious if i could have a meal and sleep in your house

for tonight""

the old chinese man says ""i'll let you come in on one

condition: you cannot mess around with my granddaughter""

the man, exhausted and hungry readily agrees, saying ""i

promise i won't cause you any trouble. i'll be on my way

tomorrow morning""

the old chinese man counters ""ok, but if i do catch you then i'll give 

you the three worst chinese torture tests ever known to man.""

""ok, ok"" the man said as he entered the old house. besides, he thought 

to himself, what kind of woman would live out in the wilderness all her 

life?

well, that night, when the man came down to eat (after showering), he 

saw how beautiful the granddaughter was. she was an absolute pearl, and 

while he had only been lost three weeks, it had been many, many months 

without companionship. and the girl had only seen the occasional monk 

besides her grandfather and well, they both couldn't keep their eyes off 

each other throughout the meal.

that night, the man snuck into the girls' bedroom and they had quite a 

time, but had kept the noise down to a minimum. the man crept back to 

his room later that night thinking to himself, ""any three torture tests 

would be worth it after that experience.""

well, the next morning the man awoke to a heavy weight on his chest. he 

opened his eyes and there was this huge rock on his chest. on the rock 

was a sign saying ""1st chinese torture test: 100 lb. rock on your 

chest"".

""what a lame torture test"" the man thought to himself as he got up and 

walked over to the window. he opened the shutter and threw the rock out. 

on the backside of the rock is another sign saying ""2nd worst chinese 

torture test: rock tied to right testicle"".

the man, seeing the rock was too far out the window to be grabbed, jumps 

out the window after the rock. outside the window is a third sign saying

the faces of the other two women were filled with amazement.

* **miss catarina**: *i will predict the names of your children and explain some history behind why it was chosen!*

* **miss catarina**: *i see you are confused my child, but be no more. you would most likely recognize your name as penny! it is short for penelope! do you know why your name is penny? it’s because your mommy loves collecting money! all kinds of money! old money, new money and even foreign money!*

the first two women cheered while confirming that it is correct. the third woman was a bit shocked but still skeptical. 

* **miss catarina**: *it was nice meeting you, penelope!*

she then moves to the second child.

* **miss catarina**: *hello my little angel. you must be lillian!*

* **lillian**: *yes! but everyone calls me lilly!*

* **miss catarina**: *and i bet that is because your mommy loves flowers! all types of flowers! wild flowers, house flowers and even exotic flower!*

the two women confirmed with excitement! but now the skeptical woman is concern.

* **miss catarina**: *it’s a pleasure meeting you, lillian.*

saving the best for last, she walks over to the third child.

* **miss catarina**: *and you my handsome prince. your name is the most fitting of all!* 

while feeling embarrassed, the skeptical woman cuts off miss catarina.

* **skeptical woman**: *i’ve had enough! my son and i do not want to hear what you have to say! we’re leaving!*

while looking at the sad little boy getting taken out the shop, miss catarina shouts to him.

* **miss catarina**: *you have a wonderful day, richard!*

75798,A story about a man named Yuri,"there once was a man named yuri.

yuri had lived in russia all of his life, in a small town near moscow. the town had horrible weather conditions almost all of the time and very few people lived there. everyone living in the town was struggling to survive in such poor conditions. yuri had lived alone in a small house in this town. he worked every day at a factory that was close to this town. it was hard work, and yuri was never very happy with his work, but he kept enduring the rough conditions to be able to have an income. yuri's life had been like this for several years, and he had endured many hardships during these times.

every day, while yuri was taking his walk to the factory before work began, he always passed by a large billboard on the side of the road. the billboard changed every month or so, usually showing an irrelevant advertisement for something that yuri had little interest in. today, however, yuri noticed a new advertisement on the billboard. it read, ""swimming lessons"" in large letters, accompanied by a picture of a large man swimming through the water. this ad had given yuri something to be interested in. he had always had an intense passion for swimming, but it was always too difficult to practice in the frigid waters of the lake near his home. yuri continued to read the ad before he finally came to the price: 5000 rubles base fee.

yuri was sad, because this was much more than yuri could afford to spend. however, he thought to himself, ""if i could save up enough money from the factory work, then by the end of the month, i should have enough..."" after this, he decided that day that he would work as hard as he could to make sure he had enough money by the end of the month. he even had to cut back his food supply by just a small amount to still have enough money. finally, at the end of the month, yuri finally had enough money to be able to go to the swimming pool not far from his home where the practices were being held.

every day after his hard work at the factory, he greatly enjoyed going back to the pool and practicing his swimming. he had started quickly and advanced rapidly. everyone who frequented the pool to practice their swimming was impressed by yuri's natural ability to be able to learn and adapt so quickly, becoming very popular with the people at the pool, his hometown, and even in moscow. it was truly a passion of yuri's.

a few months had passed, and yuri's amazing swimming abilities had been noticed by people in places all across russia, considering a swimming prodigy. yuri was always modest about his skills, but was humble nonetheless. however, he still had to continue his work at the factory, and live in the same small house he had lived in since he was born. for him, swimming was the one thing that saved him from the cruel and harsh life he lived.

later that month, on his way to the factory once again, he had noticed that the billboard he so often passed had changed once again. while it was difficult to read in the unrelenting snowstorm, he managed to make out the words ""diving practices"" in big letters. diving was something that yuri had also found to be interesting, but could never find the time nor place to practice properly. the pool he went to had no diving boards or excessively deep sections of the pool, so it was hard for yuri to practice diving. however, this would give him another opportunity to pursue what he wanted to do. he looked down at the bottom of the billboard and saw something that, like the other ad, made his heart drop. the base fee was 7500 rubles.

yuri knew that it would take another month or two of hard work at the factory to be able to achieve such a high sum of money. the factory was beginning to offer less and less money to yuri, making life harder on him than it was before. he had to cut back his food money as well to accommodate for this. however, yuri overcame the hardships in his life and save up just enough money by the end of two months.

the practices were held at another pool not far from the one he already went to, so it was easy for him to practice both swimming and diving at once. he continued to master his swimming skills while also learning how to practice diving. much like with swimming, however, he had picked up skills quickly, and it only took him another few months before he had mastered diving.

many people had heard of yuri at this point. several news stories across russia were focused around yuri, who was considered to be the best swimmer and diver in the whole country. he continued to remain incredibly modest through all of his interviews. ""it is only something i am fond of, a hobby"" yuri would say. ""i still have a life in the factory that i must attend to every day. it is a hard life, so swimming and diving are what i use to keep myself healthy."" despite his fame and popularity, yuri did continue to work at the factory day in and day out, receiving little pay and little food for all of his hard work. despite all of yuri's hardships, he continued his daily routine of working, swimming, and diving.

for yet another time, yuri was on his way to the factory. the billboard had changed once again. yuri anticipated something exciting on the billboard, and he was not disappointed at what he saw. ""travel to america today!"" read the ad. yuri was very interested. he had always heard of america, and had heard nothing but positive things about it. the land of the free! it was a very exciting idea to yuri. however, he knew that with ads like these, he knew they would come at a steep price. unfortunately, he thought correctly. the boats that traveled to america were advertised as costing 60,000 rubles.

yuri knew that that kind of sum would come from only another year or so of hard work at the factory. the factory work had become increasingly more difficult every single day, with little pay, food, and free time. however, he endured the next year the same way he endured the previous years: with swimming and diving. it truly was his passion, and yuri was not sure on how he would have survived without them.

finally, the year had passed, and yuri had finally saved up enough rubles to be able to ride the boat to america. he climbed aboard the boat with all of his possessions with him, all managing to fit in one small suitcase. the boat was somewhat small in size, being able to house only around 20 or so people. the boat set sail across the cold waters of the ocean. about a day had passed when people had finally recognized yuri, the famed russian swimmer and diver. they were all very excited to meet yuri, and had several questions to ask him about his swimming skills. ""it is nothing much, just a passion of mine, that is all. it is something i use to endure the hardships and trials of my life..."" yuri would always respond to his fans.

one day the boat had to make a stop at a small island to fill up the boat's gas supply, for they had much less than they had expected to have. it was a nice, sunny day outside, and the water was said to be very warm. one of the passengers asked yuri to show off some of his diving techniques to his fans, since they had time to kill before the boat would depart again. ""hey, yuri! while we wait, could you show us some of your diving skills? i would love to see them!"" yuri was hesitant at first. another passenger asked, ""and maybe once you have done that, could you show us your swimming techniques? the water is warm, and it would make my day to see them!"" yuri replied, ""well... ok, if you all insist i do it.""

yuri looked off the side of the boat. on the bottom of the boat, a balcony extended from the bottom. yuri feared he might hit the balcony on his dive down, but everyone else assured yuri that he wouldn't hit it in a million years. yuri stepped up over the railing, onto the side of the boat. with the same skill that he had used so many times before, he demonstrated his graceful diving skills by performing his favorite dive he knew. his fans watched in amazement as his body twirled through the air beautifully, showing the same amount of skill he put into each of his other dives. as he dove down towards the war waters below, people watched and expected for yuri to land smoothly in the water.

unfortunately, yuri never landed in the water. he landed instead on the solid, hard deck of the boat's balcony below. the impact sounded painful, and all of the spectators winced on pain over his fall. yuri remained motionless for several seconds, and his fans began to worry. many people were about to call for medics when yuri managed to get up slowly. ""are you alright yuri? that fall looked hard! that must have broken some bones!"" yuri, however, had barely an injury. as he had gotten up, he simply regained his sense of direction. this had amazed several people, as that kind of a fall would have surely broken any other person's bones, if not killed them. instead, yuri simply stood up with barely a scratch, and waved back at the row of spectators.

""it is ok, everybody"" yuri yelled back. ""i have endured many hardships in my life.""",2,18,4,1565237680.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cnghfx/a_story_about_a_man_named_yuri/

49554,Have I ever told you the story of the lemon and the priest? I don’t think so.,"there was an american priest, who just finished being ordained. his first assignment was in venezuela, where he would travel to different villages and hold church services. on sunday, he went to the main village, and on monday, tuesday, wednesday, thursday, and friday, he went to different smaller villages, which left saturday to be a day of rest.

on his first day, which was a saturday, he spent his time meeting the villagers and learning about their cultures and the villages. then came sunday, which was his first church services. he made it something about giving to others and being part of something larger than yourself, which really resonated with the townsfolk. after the mass, and old man hobbled over to the priest. “father, may i please have half of a lemon?”
“what use do you have with half of a lemon?” asked the priest.
“i cannot say.”
“farewell. here is your lemon.” and the old man just hobbled away as soon as the priest turned his back. 

throughout the week, the priest traveled to different villages, bringing his knowledge and love to the villagers. it was the second sunday since he had arrived, and the priest gave another very good sermon. after the mass, the same old man approached the priest and asked for the lemon, but right as the priest gave him the lemon, and before he could ask about it, the old man hobbled away. the priest was curious, but didn’t do much about it. 

this continued for another month, each week, the old man asked for another half of a lemon. eventually, he decided he was going to follow the old man. so when he gave him the half of a lemon the next week, he chased after him. at first, the old man just hobbled along, but once he got into a small alley, he started running. then, as he reached the open fields, he broke out into a full-on sprint. the priest, in no shape to follow, quickly slowed down, and returned to the village. after this encounter, he decided to train, so every day, he would wake up 1 hour early and go running. he did this for 3 whole months.

finally, he felt ready to catch the old man. after giving another outstanding service, the old man asked for another half of a lemon. as soon as the left the church, the priest dashed after him. once they got to a small alley, the old man started jogging. and then they reached the open fields, and he started sprinting. this time, however, the priest could keep up. the ran for about 2 miles, and reached a river with raging rapids. rocks poked out randomly, and it led to a waterfall. without hesitating, the old man dove into the water and swam across. the priest, unfortunately didn’t know how to swim, so he returned to the village. that was when he decided to wake up 2 hours earlier, 1 hour for running, and 1 hours for swimming. 

as 3 months passed, he determined that he was ready to chase the old man, and finally find out what he is up to. so after the church service, he gave the old man half of a lemon. when he hobbled out of the door, the priest was in hot pursuit. the old man turned down an alleyway and started jogging, and once he reached the fields, he started sprinting. as the arrived at the river, the old man dove in the water without a second thought. the priest, a little more careful than the old man, took his time crossing the water, as he didn’t want to get hurt. when he climbed out of the river, the old man was nowhere to be found. it seemed he ran off into the thick forest, but the priest knew mother about tracking people, so he returned to the village.

when he arrived, he asked the local hunters could teach him their ways. they said yes, but only if he went out hunting with them. so he did, going every saturday with the hunters, and learning tricks such as tracking prey, cornering them, and how to not end up getting followed yourself. after 6 months, the priest was proficient in their ways, and he felt ready to chase the old man.

after giving yet another mass in the beautiful church, he handed the old man half of a lemon. the old man hobbled out of the door, and the priest followed. they turned down a dark alley, and once they were in the fields, it was a full sprint. as the reached the river, the old man dove in carelessly, as he did before. the priest then followed, crossing quicker then he did previously. once he climbed out of the river bank, he ran over to the woods. there, he used his knew found skills to track the old man to a clearing, where he was resting. the old man saw the priest, yelped, and ran away. the priest, still chasing the old man, followed him all the way to a gigantic tree. there, the old man climbed up the tree with ease. the priest, however, was unable to climb the tree, so he returned to the village.

he concluded that in order to catch the old man, he must learn how to climb, so every day, he would wake up 3 hours early, 1 hour of running, 1 hour of swimming, and 1 hour of climbing (whatever he could find, including the old church itself). after 3 months of doing this, he felt ready to finally catch the old man. after giving him half of a lemon, he chased him through the town, into the fields, swam through the river, and made it to the woods, where the old man stopped to rest in a new clearing. he ran to the giant tree, and climbed up like it was nothing, and the priest followed on his tail. when they reached the top, the old man started swinging from vine to vine, but the priest didn’t know which vines were poisonous and which would actually hold his weight, so he went back to the village.

there, he employed the help of the gardeners, who knew everything there is to know about plants. he spent 6 months of saturdays learning the different plants, including vines. finally, he was ready to catch the old man. when he gave the old man the lemon, he dashed out of the church to catch him. he ran through the field, swam through the river with ease, and chased him all the way to the gigantic tree, which the both climbed up relatively quickly. this time, the priest was able to follow the old man through the vines, all the way to a house. the old man dashed inside the little shack and locked the door. “let me in” said the priest, but he got no response. so he went back home.

this time, he went to the locksmith, who agreed to help teach him to pick locks, but only if the priest learned how to make locks first. so the priest spent every saturday for 6 months learning this trade, and eventually, he was ready to finally catch the old man. he handed him the lemon, and chased the old man through the village. the made it across the river, and into the clearing. he chased the old man all the way up the big tree, and they both swung across the vines like tarzan. when the priest made it to the shack, he picked the lock open. he entered the little shack, which had no windows, and realized he couldn’t see. “crap, i forgot a flashlight.” he exclaimed. 

the next week, he made sure he had a flashlight. he chased the old man all through the village, down to the river, out into the clearing, up the biggest tree in the woods, through the vines like a monkey, and all the way to the little shack. the priest picked the lock, and entered the house with the flashlight on. there, he saw the old man huddle in the corner. “ it’s ok. i only want to know what you are doing with these lemons.” he said.
the old man replied: “ ok, but only if you promise to never tell a soul.”
“i swear to god” said the priest. 
so the old man walked up to him, and whispered into his ear. and like the priest promised, he never told a single soul what the old man does with those lemons.",2,7,8,1558644217.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bs81jt/have_i_ever_told_you_the_story_of_the_lemon_and/

118304,Adam was born in Hong Kong,"adam was born in hong kong as the seventh child to the lee family, who were loving parents. adam's parents had moved to hong kong in from a small village in the xinjiang province of china in search of a better life for them and their family.

however, due to a lack of proper education in their village, they struggled to find work and both ended up working as cleaners in a university, earning minimum wage and they struggled day to day to get by. however, they were loving parents, and gave everything they could to their children. adam had a happy childhood, a better education, and loved his mother and father dearly. 

the day after completing his final school exams, young adam's world was torn apart.his parents had been killed in a tragic boating accident while they we celebrating their 30th wedding anniversary. this devastated the teenager, he adored his parents and felt he has lost his whole world. he decided to go travelling to get away from the life in hong kong, where every day he was reminded of those he had lost. using his meagre inheritance, he booked a ticket to london and packed a single bag, not looking back.

adam lived the high life, working in hotels and bars, he travelled europe, drinking and partying his sorrows away. after a good six months, he met a girl and settled in amsterdam, which was as good a city for the young man as you can imagine. he was fed up with the lifestyle of hospitality work, and found an ad for a job as apprentice cheese maker, of all things, studying the profession under the tutelage of franciscus veltman, a cheese maker world renowned, his edam especially was constantly voted the best in all of the netherlands. as such they technique and recipe was a closely guarded secret, only known to franciscus himself.

things unfortunately faded away with the girl, as young love tends to do, however adam had inherited his parents work ethic, and turned out to be a natural at making cheese. he and his mentor formed a close bond, with franciscus, who was unable to have a family of his own, loved and looked after adam as if he was his was his own son; and adam himself looked up to him as a father. he had even finally taught adam the secret edam recipe, strengthening the bond between the two.

with the help of adam, franciscus' business went from strength to strength, and after 3 years, he decided to take well deserved vacation for the first time in decades, such was his dedication to caseiculture, safe in the knowledge that his livelihood was in good hands with adam at the helm. he booked himself on a week long cruise down the danube, as he'd always wanted to see the beauty of budapest. 

alas, tragedy struck again, as the cruise ship capsized, and franciscus drowned in his cabin. for the second time on his still early life, adam had been left heartbroken. he couldn't bring himself to stay in amsterdam, packed his things and moved back to hong kong.

never one to be fully hindered by adversity, adam used his skills and started his own cheese shop in his hometown. again, thanks to adam's hard work, talent and dedication, this was a roaring success, he made cheeses from all over the world that delighted the taste buds off anyone who tried them. as a tribute to dear old franciscus, he however never sold his world famous edam, only keeping it to make at home and treat those nearest to his heart. despite constant calls from cheese lovers the world over who had tasted the edam in holland, adam never wavered, and the cheese was never sold to the baying public.

adam at this point fell in love with the daughter of the owner of the florist next door to his shop, a beautiful young lady called chen. he finally plucked up the courage to ask chen out, ask took her to the finest restaurant in hong kong. chen fell for adam's wit and charm, and before long they were married in a lavish ceremony. 

six months of marital bliss later, chen becomes pregnant. adam is delighted, with his life finally coming together. when chen goes into labour, adam rushes to the hospital. ten painful hours later, and chen gives birth, not to a child, but to a deer! everyone is in shock, and experts the world over descend on hong kong to witness this miracle of science, but no one can explain it.

nevertheless, adam and chen treat the deer as if it was human, and in a fitting tribute name him franciscus after his mentor and father figure, but along the way, shorten it to frank for ease. young frank, despite the media attention, lives a sheltered childhood, and learns to walk, speak, goes to school, and leads as normal a life as an anthropomorphic deer could do.

adam continues to run his now thriving cheese business, and still keeps the masterful edam just for special occasions with his new family, and frank adores it, counting down the days until the next event when adam brings it out to share.

frank continues his education, but a final tragedy was awaiting adam. chen, while out on a sailing holiday in the south china sea with her now retired parents, fell overboard and was killed by a shark attack. 

adam, after another cruel accident taking another loved one, cannot take anymore, and moves back to his parents village in xinjiang, as far away from any large water sources as possible. he lives as a recluse, hiding away from the world in grief and sorrow. 

it's left to young frank to run the cheese business. he, unfortunately, is not as adept at cheese making or running a business as his father, and the company starts to struggle. realising this, he writes to his father for the legendary edam recipe to sell to help revive the fortunes. his father, now a stubborn, grouchy soul, steadfast refuses out of tribute to franciscus. 

frank continues to just about keep the business afloat for the next few years, but every six months sends the same letter to his father asking for the recipe that could turn around his fortunes, but is constantly refused.

finally, frank hears word that adam is on his death bed, his grief stricken body as succumbed to cancer. frank rushes to xinjiang, to find adam in a terrible state, with only hours to live. after a long and tearful goodbye, frank again asks for the recipe. 

adam, gives him a long look up and down, and says with his dying breath ""i don't know how many times i have to tell you this, but frank lee, my deer, i don't give edam.""

&nbsp;


the two treants slowly turned around and looked upon him with suspicious eyes, however they soon relaxed as they realised the elf was alone and not armed.

&nbsp;


“we have no king, only the great elder, you can carry onwards west until you find the tall ebony arches which signifies the royal halls.” one treant said, speaking softly and well-mannered, before him and his friend turned back to work on the mysterious tree.

&nbsp;


curious, the elf wished to learn more about what the treants were doing;

“what is it that you’re working on?” he asked,

&nbsp;


yet again, the treants slowly turned around before stating;
“this is the communication tree, it has magic infused within which can allow us to speak with our kind through it’s many branches, it is our job to send messages and keep it well-maintained.”

&nbsp;


satisfied, the elf thanked them for the information and carried on towards the royal halls.

&nbsp;


upon arrival, he was ushered into the great elder’s chambers, where he was met with darkness and a great silence.

&nbsp;


suddenly, a loud, booming voice echoed through the room;
“who enters the great chamber?”

&nbsp;


the elf was rather spooked by the noise and slinked back before whimpering out the words “i am just a messenger from the elven kingdom,”

&nbsp;


out of the corner of the room, a giant tree with grey bark and ritualistic carvings slowly stepped into the dim light.

&nbsp;


“i welcome you,” the treat said, a little more softly this time, “i apologise for any discomfort i may have caused you, for sometimes even i do not know the strength of my own voice.”

&nbsp;


the elf delivered the letter to the elder and turned to leave, but was stopped by the great elder;

&nbsp;


“wait, before you go, i wish to apologise for scaring you, it was not my intention. please, allow me,”

&nbsp;


the treant gave the confused elf food and water before speaking again;

&nbsp;


“i wish to talk to you, i am over a thousand years old and i do not get much company aside from other treants who come here only to worship me. please, i am somewhat lonely, will you stay and chat with me?”

&nbsp;


the elf didn’t want to refuse an offer from the great elder - that would be insulting to the whole treant kingdom! so, he accepted, and the two sat for hours chatting about their lives, the elven and treant homes, the differences between their races and how the letter the elf had just delivered was a peace offering between the two kingdoms. 

&nbsp;


however, it was clear that the elder had very poor social skills, as he sounded and looked uncomfortable and sometimes had nothing to say.

&nbsp;


to lighten the mood, the elf decided to tell a joke.

&nbsp;


he said, “why did the boar cross the footpath?”

&nbsp;


after a few seconds of intense contemplation, the elder replied “in order for the boar to cross the footpath, it would have had to have been close to the road, however they are skittish creatures and often do not wander into intelligent civilisation, so the probability of this occurrence would be so incredibly low that i have not considered it ever happening, and unfortunately i do not have an answer to this question.”

&nbsp;


the elf, dumbfounded, decided to carry on with the joke and say,
“to get to the other side!”

&nbsp;


the great elder thought for an even longer duration, before finally replying,

“yes, i suppose that is a plausible reason for movement.”

&nbsp;


the elf then realised that the treant had never heard a joke in it’s life! he decided to then teach the elder how to tell jokes. he explained, in detail, the intricacies of humour to the elder, who quietly listened with intent. 

&nbsp;


finally, the elf said, “i have taught you all i know, now i wish to see if i have been successful in my mentoring, please tell me a joke,”

&nbsp;


the elder steeled himself and thought precariously for 4 long minutes, the elf getting impatient, before finally beginning to speak.

&nbsp;


“why did the griffin fly south instead of east in the springtime?”

&nbsp;


the elf replied “i don’t know, why *did* the griffin fly south instead of east in the springtime?”

&nbsp;


the great treant then replied, in the most monotonous voice; “because he thought that it was summertime instead of springtime!”

&nbsp;


the great elder burst out laughing with the deepest and heartiest laugh imaginable.

&nbsp;


“do you understand? because griffins normally fly east in the springtime and south in the summertime, but this particular griffin had mistaken springtime for summertime and flown south instead of east!”

&nbsp;


the elf, not wanting to cause any insult, decided to laugh along with the great one, however he did not feel like the elder truly understood the concept of a joke.

&nbsp;


upon leaving the kingdom to return to his home, the elf found the first two treants he had seen on his journey, and wanted to thank them before making his return.

&nbsp;


as he approached, he saw that they were still working on the magical tree used for the treant’s communications. this time it was twitching and lighting up, it seems the tree was working and the treants were sending messages.

&nbsp;


“hello, i thank you again for your directions, i have successfully delivered my letter and will be heading off shortly.”

&nbsp;


the treants slowly turned around before waving him off before one treant said
“watch out for the two-dimensional spiderlings, i heard that they are a real *plane* in the backside!” 

&nbsp;


the elf laughed out loud, uncontrollably from the unexpected joke.

&nbsp;


“you like that?” the other treant said, “i have one of my own, why did the necromancer’s skeletons flee the battle?”

&nbsp;


the elf smiled and waited for the punchline;


&nbsp;


“because they had no guts!”

&nbsp;


again the elf burst out laughing, even harder than the last time.

&nbsp;


“wow, you guys are great at telling jokes, much better than the great elder.” said the elf,

&nbsp;


the treants replied; “why of course, everybody knows the best jokes are always in the comm-ents!”",2,49,6,1573394830.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dubtyj/shameless_selfrepost/

6922,There was a farmer who had two sons.,"his wife died as soon as she gave birth to the second son. because of this, the farmer always blamed his second son for his mother's death. but he did not fail in his responsibilities as a father. the farmer was poor but he worked really hard to get his two sons in grad school. they didn't do well enough to get jobs. they stayed at home with their dad but the farmer never complained since his sons are all the family he had. he tried to explain to them that he was not going to be there to take care of them all the time as he was getting really old and insisted they try and find whatever jobs they could so they could support themselves. the sons agreed and started working towards getting a job. finally after a while, the first son got a job as a librarian in the public library and the second son got a job as a train conductor. the farmer was very happy now that his two sons are working and he could rest in peace. one fine day, a new family moved in next to their house. the   neighboring house had always been empty the whole time they were there. the new neighbors had a beautiful daughter. the two sons were immediately attracted to her. they would do her chores, get her gifts, constantly visit her family in the pursuit of getting her attention. on fine day, the elder son went to her and told her how he really felt about her and that he would take care of her for the rest of her life. but the girl was not interested in him, so to let him off easily, she said she had feelings for his younger brother and that nothing can ever happen between them. the elder son understood and wished her all the best and left. the same evening, the younger son went to her and told her how he felt about her. she told him she liked his elder brother and that nothing could ever happen between them. the younger son did not take this well. he was furious with his brother and felt he had betrayed him. he went home to confront him about this and the two brothers got into an argument. the elder one denied that  he betrayed him and called him a fool for even thinking that. the argument got heated up so bad that they ended up fighting. in the spur of the moment, the younger one pushed his brother and accidentally killed him. he did not know what to do. his father already blames him for his mother's death. but later that evening, the farmer returned home and found his elder son dead on the floor, the younger one just sitting there cold. he could not believe this had happened. he did not show any anger towards his younger son but decided in his mind that he would put an end to all this misery. they buried the elder one in secrecy and told the neighbors he had gone abroad. after a few days, the farmer prepared a nice meal and drugged it, and asked his son to join him. his son, unsuspecting of anything, joined him for supper and had the meal and within a few minutes, was out-cold. the farmer dragged him to the basement, tied him up to a chair, connected some wires to him and let him there after switching it on, hoping he   would be electrocuted and dead. but the next morning, the farmer heard his son shouting for help. so he went down and was shocked to see nothing had happened. the son cried to his father and begged for forgiveness. the farmer did not want to forgive him, but was past the rage episode so he did not want to kill him anymore. he asked his son to get out of his sight and never wanted to see him again. the son obliged and promised he would never return home and left. the son moved to another place. he had all the time to think about what he had done and regretted it. over the next few months, he changed into a completely different human being. he became kind, calm, composed and very helpful to others. one day when he was walking down the street, he noticed a homeless person begging for food. he was moved and he got him some food and asked the homeless person to have it. while the homeless person was eating, the son noticed there was a fly on his cheek. so he tried to swat it, accidentally slapping him. the farmer who was also walking by that street saw this and thought his son hadn't changed a bit and now he is a danger to society. he decided he would finish the job once and for all. he called his son and invited him back home saying he wanted to spend the rest of his dying days with his family. the son was very happy. he went home and stayed with his father. the farmer prepared a sumptuous meal for them and again drugged his son's meal. like earlier, the son went out-cold in a few minutes. the farmer dragged him to the basement, tied him up to a chair, connected some wires to him, and switched it on. this time, the son got electrocuted and died instantly. do you know why? because the first time, he was a bad conductor, but now he is a good conductor.

52449,A week at the gym,"dear diary

for my fortieth birthday this year, my wife (the dear) purchased a week of personal training at the local health club for me.

although i am still in great shape since playing football 24 yrs ago, i decided it would be a good idea to go ahead and give it a try.

called the club and made my reservation with a personal trainer named vanessa, who identified herself as a 26 year old aerobics instructor and model for athletic clothing and swimwear.

my wife seemed pleased with my enthusiasm to get started! the club encouraged me to keep a diary to chart my progress

monday:

started my day at 6:00am. tough to get out of bed, but it was well worth it when i arrived at the health club to find vanessa waiting for me. she was something of a greek goddess with blonde hair, dancing eyes and a dazzling white smile. woo hoo!!!!!

vanessa gave me a tour and showed me the machines. she took my pulse after 5 minutes on the treadmill. she was alarmed that my pulse was so fast, but i attributed it to standing next to her in her lycra aerobics outfit. very inspiring, vanessa was encouraging as i did my sit-ups, although my gut was already aching from holding it in the whole time she was around. i enjoyed watching the skilful way in which she conducted her aerobics class after my workout today.

this is going to be a fantastic week!!

tuesday:

i drank a whole pot of coffee, but i finally made it out of the door. vanessa made me lie on my back and push a heavy iron bar into the air, and then she put weights on it! my legs were a little wobbly on the treadmill, but i made the full mile. vanessa's rewarding smile made it all worthwhile. i feel great!! it's a whole new life for me.

wednesday:

the only way that i can brush my teeth is by laying on the toothbrush on the counter and moving my mouth back and forth over it. i believe i have a hernia in both breasts. driving was ok as long as i didn't try to steer or stop. vanessa was impatient with me, insisting that my screams bothered other club members.

her voice is a little too perky for early in the morning and when she scolds, she gets this nasally whine that is very annoying. my chest hurts when i got on the treadmill, so vanessa put me on the stair monster. why the hell would anyone invent a machine to simulate an activity rendered obsolete by elevators?

vanessa told me it would help me get in shape and enjoy life.

she said some other sh#t too.

thursday:

vanessa was waiting for me with her vampire-like teeth exposed as her thin, cruel lips were pulled back in a full snarl. i couldn't help being a half an hour late; it took me that long to tie my shoes. vanessa took me to work out with dumbbells. when she was not looking, i ran and hid in the men's room. she sent lars to find me, then, as punishment, put me on the rowing machine.

friday:

i hate that b#tch vanessa more than any human being has ever hated any other human being in the history of the world. stupid, skinny, anaemic little cheerleader. if there were a part of my body i could move without unbearable pain, i would beat her with it. vanessa wanted me to work on my triceps - i don't have any triceps! and if you don't want dents in the floor, don't hand me the barbells or anything that weighs more than a sandwich. the treadmill flung me off and i landed on a health and nutrition teacher. why couldn't it have been someone softer, like the drama coach or the choir director?

saturday:

vanessa left a message on my answering machine in her grating, shrilly voice wondering why i did not show up today. just hearing her made me want to smash the machine with my fist. however, i lacked the strength to even use the tv remote and ended up catching eleven straight hours of the shopping channel.

sunday:

i'm having the church van pick me up for services today so i can go and thank god that this week is over. i will also pray that next year, my wife (the b#tch), will choose a gift for me that is fun -- like a root canal or a vasectomy.",2,13,4,1559291855.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bv512g/a_week_at_the_gym/

59888,[Long] Anger management,"ok, this is really long but when you finished reading, you'll have a great lige protip. 

when you occasionally have a really bad day, and you just need to take it out on someone, don't take it out on someone you know, take it out on someone you don't know.i was sitting at my desk when i remembered a phone call i'd forgotten to make. i found the number and dialed it.

a man answered, saying ""hello.""i politely said, ""this is chris. could i please speak with robyn carter?""suddenly a manic voice yelled out in my ear ""get the right f***ing number!"" and the phone was slammed down on me. i couldn't believe that anyone could be so rude .

when i tracked down robyn's correct number to call her, i found that i had accidentally transposed the last two digits.after hanging up with her, i decided to call the 'wrong' number again.when the same guy answered the phone, i yelled ""you're an asshole!"" and hung up.

i wrote his number down with the word 'asshole' next to it, and put it in my desk drawer. every couple of weeks, when i was paying bills or had a really bad day, i'd call him up and yell, ""you're an asshole!"" it always cheered me up.

when caller id was introduced, i thought my therapeutic 'asshole' calling would have to stop. so, i called his number and said, ""hi,this is john smith from the telephone company. i'm calling to see if you're familiar with our caller id program?""he yelled ""no!"" and slammed down the phone. i quickly called him back and said, ""that's because you're an asshole!"" and hung up.

one day i was at the store, getting ready to pull into a parking spot. some guy in a black bmw cut me off and pulled into the spot i had patiently waited for. i hit the horn and yelled that i'd been waiting for that spot, but the idiot ignored me. i noticed a ""for sale"" sign in his back window, so i wrote down his number. a couple of days later, right after calling the first asshole (i had is number on speed dial,) i thought that i'd better call the bmw asshole, too.

i said, ""is this the man with the black bmw for sale?""he said, ""yes, it is."" i asked, ""can you tell me where i can see it?"" he said, ""yes, i live at 34 oaktree blvd, in fairfax. it's a yellow ranch, and the car's parked right out in front.""

i asked, ""what's your name?"" he said, ""my name is don hansen,"" i asked, ""when's a good time to catch you, don?"" he said, ""i'm home every evening after five.""

i said, ""listen, don, can i tell you something?""

he said, ""yes?""

i said, ""don, you're an asshole!""

then i hung up, and added his number to my speed dial, too.

now, when i had a problem, i had two assholes to call.

then i came up with an idea. i called asshole #1. he said, ""hello."" i said, ""you're an asshole!"" (but i didn't hang up.) he asked, ""are you still there?"" i said, ""yeah,"" he screamed, ""stop calling me,"" i said, ""make me,"" he asked, ""who are you?"" i said, ""my name is don hansen."" he said, ""yeah? where do you live?"" i said, ""asshole, i live at 34 oaktree blvd, in fairfax, a yellow ranch, i have a black beamer parked in front."" he said, ""i'm coming over right now, don. and you had better start saying your prayers."" i said, ""yeah, like i'm really scared, asshole,"" and hung up.

then i called asshole #2. he said, ""hello?"" i said, ""hello, asshole,"" he yelled, ""if i ever find out who you are..."" i said, ""you'll what?"" he exclaimed, ""i'll kick your ass,"" i answered, ""well, asshole, here's your chance. i'm coming over right now.""

then i hung up and immediately called the police, saying that i lived at 34 oaktree blvd, in fairfax, and that i was on my way over there to kill my gay lover.

then i called channel 9 news about the gang war going down in oaktree blvd. in fairfax.

i quickly got into my car and headed over to fairfax. i got there just in time to watch two assholes beating the crap out of each other in front of six cop cars, an overhead news helicopter and surrounded by a news crew.

now i feel much better. anger management really does work.",2,145,12,1561117559.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/c39ki2/long_anger_management/
52394,"Jack, a renown atheist, dies..."," 

... and to his utter surprise ends up in hell where he's greeted by satan himself.

completely shocked he talks to the devil and says: ""welp, i've been wrong all my life and i guess i'm now to pay the price for my lack of faith""

satan laughs and replies: ""awh it's not so bad down here, let me give you the tour so you can see for yourself""

he then proceeds to escort jack through a beautiful lush green plain with flowers, scattered here and there there's a bunch of houses where other ""damned"" live.

as they pass through each house the inhabitants recognize satan and invite them inside for a drink and a chat, request that's always granted by the two.

every time they stop to a house satan never fails to display how much of a lovely guy he really is by telling amazing stories, singing, cracking jokes and just generally being a great person.

at sunset the devil sees that jack was very tired and decides to show him the house he'll be spending the rest of eternity into.

as they walk to jack's new house the two pass close to a huge wall and jack asks: ""what's behind there?""

satan: ""oh, nothing that should concern you, pay it no mind""

despite his curiosity jack thought better not to bother satan with further questions and just followed him to his new house where satan promised he'd be back the following morning to show him the recreational center before finally bidding him a goodnight after a long day.

that night however jack kept thinking back at the whole situation he's in and how surreal everything was until his thoughts eventually jumped to the wall he saw earlier in the day.

after a few minutes trying to guess what could there be behind that wall that satan couldn't even tell him he decided he should investigate, as such he took a deep breath and dived into the night walking back to the place where the wall was.

once there he searched for some clues until he saw some faint light coming from a spot in the wall; upon closer inspection he saw that there was a hole and the light was coming from behind the wall.

jack took a deep breath and scrounged up the courage to look into the crack on the wall and what he saw was a spectacle much alike what he always thought hell would be.

on the other side of the wall huge flames were scattered all over a burnt and scalding hot ground and much to his horror he saw other souls inside that nightmare being eternally burned and never consuming, screaming and pleading for help.

jack rushed back into his place where he just quietly sobbed and cried all night for he was sure now that the devil was just toying with him to give him a bit of hope right before tossing him into eternal despair.

the following morning satan showed up once again and told jack to come with him.

jack pleaded: ""please! please! don't take me to hell, i'll do anything just let me stay here, i don't wanna burn for all eternity!""

satan: ""what are you talking about??? i'm just gonna show you the recreational center like i told you yesterday""

jack: ""don't lie to me, i saw what was going on behind the giant wall!""

satan: ""ooooh you saw that! don't worry that's not for you, that's the christian hell""

jack: ""the christian hell? why would the christian hell be like that?""

""it was absolutely wonderful,"" explained the woman, ""not only did we arrive on time in one of continental's brand new jets, but it was overbooked and they bumped us up to first class. the food and wine were wonderful, and i had a handsome 28 year old steward who waited on me hand and foot.

and the hotel -- it was fabulous! they'd just finished a $5 million remodeling job and now it's just a jewel, the finest hotel in the city. they, too, were overbooked, so they apologized and gave us their owner's suite at no extra charge!""

""well,"" muttered the hairdresser, ""i know you didn't get to see the pope.""

""actually, we were quite lucky, for as we toured the vatican, a swiss guard tapped me on the shoulder and explained that the pope likes to personally meet some of the visitors, and if i'd be so kind as to step into his private room and wait, the pope would personally greet me."" sure enough, five minutes later, the holy father walked through the door and shook my hand! i knelt down and he spoke a few words to me.""

95851,"In Celebration of my Cake Day, here's a terrible joke: the Olympic Swimmer and his Son","michael was a famous olympic swimmer.  recently retired, it was his dream to continue his legacy by teaching his son the art of swimming.  they had practiced for years, and when michael's son was ready, he was entered into his first ever tournament.  
  
the first round was easy.  after all, the son had been training for years, and had the best coach in the nation.  but, by the time things progressed to the quarterfinals, his times didn't look good.  michael's son was in dead last.  
  
""dad, i don't think i'm going to win this one.  i'm sorry."" he said.  
  
""have no fear, son.  i swam in tournaments for years.  i know a few tricks."" replied michael.
  
""tricks? like cheating?"" inquired the son.  
  
""no, nothing like that."" said michael.  ""it's all about aerodynamics.  for example, your swim trunks are medium sized.  go into the locker room and change into a small.  you'll be more streamlined and go faster.""  
  
the boy did as instructed, and proceeded to the quarterfinals.  the gun went off, the race started, and the son finished his heat and was able to advance to the semifinals... but only, just barely.  
  
""well, dad, i think that helped, but i think i'm doomed.  even with the extra speed, i can never win the semifinals"".  
  
""son, i know another trick.  it's all about aerodynamics.  your noseplugs-- they're too big.  switch your current ones out for a smaller size.  it will reduce the drag on your face in the water and give you a little speed boost.""  
  
again, the boy did as he was told, proceeding to the semifinals with smaller nose plugs.  once again, the gun went off, the race started, and the son finished his heat and was surprised to find that he was able to advance to the finals... but only, just barely.  
  
""dad, thank you for all you've done for me.  but, i think i'm doomed.  there's no way i can win now.  i think we're all out of tricks.""  
  
""not so, son.  i have one last trick.  it's all about aerodynamics.  you wear a size medium swimming cap.  take it off and wear a smaller size.  it will make you more streamlined and get your blood flowing better.  if you do this, you have a really good chance of winning.""  
  
the boy did as instructed.  once again, the gun went off.  the final race began.  the son started out with a massive lead, but then, something unexpected happened.  the son made it halfway through the pool when he unexpectedly started rolling sideways, and then started bobbing up and down like a cork in the water.

one day arty sees 4 mafia members sitting around a table. arty was a scrawny dude, but he had balls. he went up to the table and said ""my name is arty and i want to be in the mafia, i'll do whatever it takes""

they all looked at each other, then looked at arty and started laughing. the  leader then said, ""alright kid, we'll give you a shot. but you have to prove yourself as a professional. we will pay you 1 dollar to kill 3 people, that dollar will be your formal invite into our group""

arty was happy they gave him a shot, but he has never killed anyone before. he responds ""alright can i think about it?""

to which they say ""you will have till tomorrow morning to complete the task, if we see it in the headlines, then we will know you completed it, if not, it'll be as if we never met""

arty say ok.

on his way home arty stops at the grocery store to pick up some things. it's kinda late, so the store is mostly empty. as arty is walking around , he sees a frail woman. he thinks to himself maybe this is my shot. so he takes it. he wraps his hands around her throat, she doesn't seem to be fighting back so he just squeezes until she dies. 

arty doesn't think anyone saw so he just goes about his business shopping, however he notices another woman following him. he thinks she must have seen it, so he attacks. he grabs a cast iron skillet from the kitchen aisle and wacks her in the head. she hits the ground and starts bleeding, but she is still moving. arty has to finish the job, so he sits on her chest and chokes her until she is no longer moving. 

at this point arty has to get out of there. he heads to the exit but there is an employee there waiting for him. he knows he has to kill him and get out asap. so they start fighting, and it's dead even. eventually arty gets the upper hand and puts the employee in a headlock and just holds it until the guy is no longer breathing. he did it, he killed three people, now he just has to get home. 

as he exits the store, the police are already outside waiting for him, and arty knows he's fucked up. he gets taken to jail, and the next day the headline reads...

“dear captain, thursday will be my daughter melinda’s debutante ball. i would like you to send four well-mannered, handsome, unmarried officers in their formal dress uniforms to attend the dance.” 

“they should arrive promptly at 8:00 pm prepared for an evening of polite southern conversation. they should be excellent dancers, as they will be the escorts of lovely refined young ladies. one last point: “no jews, please.” ""

sending a written message by his own yeoman, the captain replied: “madam, thank you for your invitation. in order to present the widest possible knowledge base for polite conversation, i am sending four of my best and most prized officers.” 

“one is a lieutenant commander, and a graduate of annapolis with an additional masters degree from mit in fluid technologies and ship design.” 

“the second is a lieutenant, one of our helicopter pilots, and a graduate of northwestern university in chicago, with a bs in 
aeronautical engineering. his masters degree and phd, in aeronautical and mechanical engineering, are from texas tech university and he is also an astronaut candidate.” 

“the third officer is also a lieutenant, with degrees in both computer systems and information technology from smu and he is awaiting notification on his doctoral dissertation from cal tech.” 

“finally, the fourth officer, also a lieutenant commander, is our ship’s doctor, with an undergraduate degree from the university of georgia and his medical degree is from the university of north carolina. we are very proud of him, as he is also a senior fellow in trauma surgery at bethesda .” 

upon receiving this letter, melinda’s mother was quite excited and looked forward to thursday with pleasure. her daughter would be escorted by four handsome naval officers without peer (and the other women in her social circle would be insanely jealous). 

at precisely 8:00 pm on thursday, melinda’s mother heard a polite rap at the door which she opened to find, in full dress uniform, four very handsome, smiling black officers. 

her mouth fell open, but pulling herself together, she stammered, “there must be some mistake.”

the old lady replied, ""i make bets."" the president then asked, ""bets? what kind of bets?"" the old woman said, ""well, for example, i'll bet you $25,000 that your balls are square.""

that night, the president got very nervous about the bet and spent a long time in front of a mirror checking his balls, turning from side to side, again and again. he thoroughly checked them out until he was sure that there was absolutely no way his balls were square and that he would win the bet.

the next morning, at precisely 10:00 am, the little old lady appeared with her lawyer at the president's office. she introduced the lawyer to the president and repeated the bet: ""$25,000 says the president's balls are square!""

the president agreed with the bet again and the old lady asked him to drop his pants so they could all see. the president complied. the little old lady peered closely at his balls and then asked if she could feel them.

""well, okay,"" said the president, ""$25,000 is a lot of money, so i guess you should be absolutely sure."" just then, he noticed that the lawyer was quietly banging his head against the wall. the president asked the old lady, ""what the hell's the matter with your lawyer?""

saint peter let out a faint chuckle, and since it was a crime of passion, he decided to let the poor soul in.

so the couple walked up to the house and knocked on the door. a warm voice said, 'come on in.'

when they opened the door they saw the damage that was done: glass was all over the place, and a broken antique bottle was lying on its side near the pieces of window glass.

a man reclining on the couch asked, 'are you the people that broke my window?'

'uh...yeah! , sir. we're sure sorry about that,' the husband replied.

'oh, no apology is necessary. actually i want to thank you.. you see, i'm a genie, and i've been trapped in that bottle for a thousand years. now that you've released me, i'm allowed to grant three wishes. i'll give you each one wish, but if you don't mind, i'll keep the last one for my self.'

wow, that's great!' the husband said. he pondered a moment and blurted out, 'i'd like a million dollars a year for the rest of my life.'

'no problem,' said the genie 'you've got it, it's the least i can do.. and i'll guarantee you a long, healthy life!'

'and now you, young lady, what do you want?' the genie asked.

'i'd like to own a gorgeous home in every country in the world complete with servants,' she said.

'consider it done,' the genie said. 'and your homes will always be safe from fire, burglary and natural disasters!'

'and now,' the couple asked in unison, 'what's your wish, genie?'

'well, since i've been trapped in that bottle, and haven't been with a woman in more than a thousand years, my wish is to have sex with your wife.'

the husband looked at his wife and said, 'gee, honey, you know we both now have a fortune, and all those houses. what do you think?'

she mulled it over for a few moments and said, 'you know, you're right. considering our good fortune, i guess i wouldn't mind, but what about you, honey?'

you know i love you sweetheart,' said the husband. i'd do the same for you!'

so the genie and the woman went upstairs where they spent the rest of the afternoon enjoying each other.

the genie was insatiable. after about three hours of non-stop sex, the genie rolled over and looked directly into her eyes and asked, how old are you and your husband?'

now, one day stanley was working out in the shed when his lit cigarette ignited a nearby gas can. the can exploded, stanley was engulfed in flames and, tragically, died from his injuries. after the police investigation ruled the explosion an accident, his mangled body was sent to the morgue. the entire front side of his body was burned beyond recognition, but everyone in town knew that if anybody could confirm it was stanley, it'd be cletus and jimmy.

""i know this isn't easy for you and i appreciate you taking the time."" cletus replied in a somber tone. ""no trouble at all, ma'am."" the mortician lifted the sheet from the body, revealing stanley's horribly burned frontside. she asked cletus if this was indeed stanley.

""weeeeeeeell,"" said cletus. ""i don't know. i really can't tell. why don't you flip him on over?"" the mortician was confused, but obliged, revealing stanley's relatively unharmed naked backside. without hesitation, cletus exclaimed, ""nope, that ain't stanley!"" the mortician was surprised, but thanked cletus again for his time and sent him on his way.

she then called jimmy to the morgue to see if he could provide a positive identification. as with cletus, she offered her sympathies and thanked him for coming in. then she pulled back the sheet and asked jimmy if he could confirm it was stanley.

""weeeeeeell,"" jimmy said pensively. ""hard to say. would it be alright if you flip him over?"" the mortician was even more surprised this time, but again obliged. after only a second, jimmy said confidently, ""nope, that ain't stanley."" the mortician was dumbfounded.

whereas the party of the first part, also known as “lawyer,” and the party of the second part, also known as “light bulb,” do hereby and forthwith agree to a transaction wherein the party of the second part (light bulb) shall be removed from the current position as a result of failure to perform previously agreed-upon duties, i.e., the illumination of the area ranging from the front (north) door, through the entryway, terminating at an area just inside the primary living area, demarcated by the beginning of the carpet, any spillover illumination being at the option of the party of the second part (light bulb) and not required by the aforementioned agreement between the parties.

the aforementioned removal transaction shall include, but not be limited to, the following steps:

1.) the party of the first part (lawyer) shall, with or without elevation, at his option, by means of a chair, step-stool, ladder, or any other means of elevation, grasp the party of the second part (light bulb) and rotate the party of the second part (light bulb) in a counterclockwise direction, said direction being non- negotiable. said grasping and rotation of the party of the second part (light bulb) shall be undertaken by the party of the first part (lawyer) with every reasonable caution by the party of the first part (lawyer) to maintain the structural integrity of the party of the second part (light bulb), notwithstanding the aforementioned failure of the party of the second part (light bulb) to perform the aforementioned customary and agreed-upon duties. the foregoing notwithstanding, however, both parties stipulate that structural failure of the party of the second part (light bulb) may be incidental to the aforementioned failure to perform, and in such case the party of the first part (lawyer) shall be held blameless for such structural failure insofar as this agreement is concerned so long as the non-negotiable directional codicil (counterclockwise) is observed by the party of the first part (lawyer) throughout.

2.) upon reaching a point where the party of the second part (light bulb) becomes separated from the party of the third part (“receptacle”), the party of the first part (lawyer) shall have the option of disposing of the party of the second part (light bulb) in a manner consistent with all applicable state, local, and federal statutes.

3.) once separation and disposal have been achieved, the party of the first part (lawyer) shall have the option of beginning installation of the party of the fourth part (“new light bulb”). this installation shall occur in a manner consistent with the reverse of the procedures described in step 1 of this document, being careful to note that the rotation should occur in a clockwise direction, said direction also being non-negotiable.

note: the above-described steps may be performed, at the option of the party of the first part (lawyer), by said party of the first part (lawyer), by his heirs and assigns, or by any and all persons authorized by him to do so, the objective being to produce a level of illumination in the immediate vicinity of the aforementioned front (north) door consistent with maximization of commerce and revenue for the party of the fifth part, also known as “the firm.”",2,137,10,1566747677.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/cva0wi/how_many_lawyers_does_it_take_to_change_a_light/

his soul arrives in heaven and is met by st. peter at the entrance.  ""welcome to heaven"", says st. peter. ""before you settle in, it seems there is a problem.  we seldom see a high official around these parts you see, so we're not sure what to do with you.""

""no problem.  just let me in,"" says the politician.

""well, i'd like to, but i have orders from the higher ups.  what we'll do is have you spend one day in hell and one in heaven.  then you can choose where to spend eternity.""

""really?  i've made up my mind.  i want to be in heaven,"" says the politician.

""i'm sorry, but we have our rules."" and with that st. peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down to hell. the doors open and he finds himself in the middle of a golf course.  in the distance a clubhouse and standing in front of it are all his friends and other politicians who had worked with him.  everyone is very happy and in evening dress.  they run to greet him, shake his hands and reminisce about the good times they had while getting both exalted and rich .  they played a friendly round of golf and then dine on lobster, maliputo, caviar, and macallan 1926.  also present is the devil who really is a very friendly guy and who is having a good time and telling jokes.  they are all having such a good time that before the politician realizes it, it is time to go.

everyone gives him a hearty farewell and waves while the elevator rises.

the elevator goes up, up and the door reopens in heaven while st. peter is waiting for him

""now it's time to visit heaven.""  so, 24 hours passed with the politician joining a group of contented souls moving from cloud to cloud,  playing the harp, cebu guitar and singing.  they have a good time and before he realizes it the 24 hours have gone by and st. peter returns.  ""well then you've spent a day in hell and another in heaven.  now choose your eternity.

""the minister reflects for a minute before he answers: ""well, i would never have said it before, i mean heaven has been delightful, but i think i would be better off in hell.""  so st. peter escorts him to the elevator and he goes down, down to hell.

now the doors of the elevator open and he's in the middle of a barren land covered with waste and garbage.  he sees all his friends, dressed in rags picking up the trash and putting it in black bags as more trash falls from above.  the devil comes over to him and puts his arm around his shoulders.

""i don't understand,"" stammers the politician.

""the other day i was here and there was a golf course and clubhouse and we ate lobster, maliputo, and caviar, drank $10,000 macallan and we flirted, danced and had a great time.  now there's just a wasteland full of garbage and my friends look miserable.  what happened?"",

65574,"A LONG ONE( but worth it): One wet, cold morning...","a bus driver was just starting along his route. it was still dark and raining and the temperature hovered just above freezing.

as he approached the first stop on his route he could see some poor soul laying on the bench. he stopped the bus, opened the doors and called out to the soaking wet person laying there.

""hey, buddy!"" the guy sat up and looked as wet and cold as he was drunk. ""hey fella, get outta the rain and on the bus.""

""i can't"", mumbled the drunk, ""i don't haff any money.""

""nevermind that, get on the bus"", said the driver kindly. so the drunk staggers up the steps and plonks down in the seat across from the driver. he looked so bedraggled and sad that the driver wanted to make him feel at least a little bit happier.

so he says to the drunk, ""hey, buddy, hey watch this!""

he stops the bus and a sour-looking older woman gets on, shaking her umbrella. she deposits her fare, and as she goes past the driver, he says, ""tickle your c#nt with a feather?""

the woman wheels around, ""what did you say?!!""

the driver answers, ""typical country weather....don't you agree?""

the woman is red-faced and embarrassed at what she thought she heard and mumbles yes, she agrees and sits herself well down the back.

the drunk is smiling a bit, so the driver knows its having a positive effect. ""watch this one"", he says.

sure enough, at the next stop another woman gets on. she looks like she's never cracked a smile in her life. as she drops in her fare and starts to move past the driver, he mumbles, ""tickle your snatch with a feather?""

the woman gasps and says,""i beg your pardon?!!""

to which the driver answers, ""i said typical nasty weather.""

the woman is completely shaken and apologises and agrees, yes the weather is atrocious. then hurries to her seat.

now the drunk is chuckling quite freely.

the driver leans over and says to the drunk, ""why don't you do the next one?""

the drunk shakes his head, ""no, i'm too dr-dr-drunk."" ""nah"", says the driver, ""you do this one.""

so as the bus stops, the drunk pulls himself up straight in the seat, smooths his clothes out and stares straight ahead. his face is a study in concentration. as the lady pays her fare and begins to pass by the drunk, he says in a clear, strong voice, ""scratch yer c#nt with a stick?""

the woman, absolutely shocked, turns to the drunk and says, ""what did you say to me?!!""

“oh, i see,” said the woman, “can’t you just let me in?”

“well, i’d like to,” said st peter, “but i have higher orders. we’re instructed to let you have a day in hell and a day in heaven, and then you are to choose where you’d like to go for all eternity.”

“actually, i think i’d prefer heaven”, said the woman. “sorry, we have rules…” at which st. peter put the hr manager into the downward bound elevator.


as the doors opened in hell she stepped out onto a beautiful golf course. in the distance was a country club; around her were many friends, past fellow executives, all smartly dressed, happy, and cheering for her. they ran up and kissed her on both cheeks, and they talked about old times.

they played a perfect round of golf and afterwards went to the country club where she enjoyed a superb steak and lobster dinner. she met the devil (who was actually rather nice) and she had a wonderful night telling jokes and dancing.

before she knew it, it was time to leave. everyone shook her hand and waved goodbye as she stepped into the elevator. the elevator went back up to heaven where st. peter was waiting for her. “now it’s time to spend a day in heaven,” he said.

so she spent the next 24 hours lounging around on clouds, playing the harp and singing; which was almost as enjoyable as her day in hell. at the day’s end st. peter returned. “so,” he said, “you’ve spent a day in hell and you’ve spent a day in heaven”. “you must choose between the two.”

the woman thought for a second and replied: “well, heaven is certainly lovely, but i actually had a better time in hell. i choose hell.”

accordingly, st. peter took her to the elevator again and she went back down to hell. when the doors of the elevator opened she found herself standing in a desolate wasteland covered in garbage and filth. she saw her friends dressed in rags, picking up rubbish and putting it in old sacks. the devil approached and put his arm around her.

“i don’t understand,” stuttered the hr manager, “the other day i was here, and there was a golf course, and a country club. we ate lobster, and we danced and had a wonderful happy time. now all there is, is just dirty wasteland of garbage and all my friends look miserable.”

84628,A rabbit walks into a pub...,"a rabbit walks into a pub and says to the barman,
'can i have a pint of beer, and a ham and cheese toastie?'

the barman is amazed, but gives the rabbit a pint of beer and a ham and cheese toastie.

the rabbit drinks the beer and eats the toastie. he then leaves.

the following night the rabbit returns and again asks for a pint of beer, and a ham and cheese toastie.

the barman, now intrigued by the rabbit and the extra drinkers in the pub, (because word gets round), gives the rabbit the pint and the toastie. the rabbit consumes them and leaves.

the next night, the pub is packed.

in walks the rabbit and says, 'a pint of beer and a ham and cheese toastie, please barman.'

the crowd is hushed as the barman gives the rabbit his pint and toastie, and then burst into applause as the rabbit wolfs them down.

the next night there is standing room only in the pub.

coaches have been laid on for the crowds of patrons attending.

the barman is making more money in one week than he did all last year

in walks the rabbit and says, 'a pint of beer and a ham and cheese toastie, please barman.'

the barman says, 'i'm sorry rabbit, old mate, old mucker, but we are right out of them ham and cheese toasties.'

the rabbit looks aghast.

the crowd has quietened to almost a whisper, when the barman clears his throat nervously and says,
'we do have a very nice cheese and onion toastie.

the rabbit looks him in the eye and says, 'are you sure i will like it.'

the crowd's bated breath is ear shatteringly silent.

the barman, with a roguish smile says, 'do you think that i would let down one of my best friends. i know you'll love it.'

'ok,' says the rabbit, 'i'll have a pint of beer and a cheese and onion toastie.'

the pub erupts with glee as the rabbit quaffs the beer and guzzles the toastie.

he then waves to the crowd and leaves....

never to return!!!!!!

one year later, in the now impoverished public house, the barman, (who has only served 4 drinks tonight, 3 of which were his), calls time.

when he is cleaning down the now empty bar, he sees a small white form, floating above the bar.

the barman says, 'who are you?

to which he is answered,
'i am the ghost of the rabbit that used to frequent your public house.'

the barman says, 'i remember you. you made me famous.

you would come in every night and have a pint of beer and a ham and cheese toastie. masses came to see you and this place was famous.'

the rabbit says, 'yes i know.'

the barman said, 'i remember, on your last night we didn't have any ham and cheese toasties. you had a cheese and onion one instead.'

the rabbit said, 'yes, you promised me that i would love it.'

the barman said, 'you never came back, what happened?'

'i died', said the rabbit.

'no!' said the barman. 'what from?'

after a short pause, the rabbit said ...

6176,"There was once, in a small town, a man named Don.","one day don was walking on top of a fence, and he slipped.  when he slipped, the fence split him in half, right up the middle, but miraculously, each half of don survived!  each half got up, started hopping away, and essentially started living separate lives.

the left half, more prone to rational thought, spent most of its time in libraries, and got an accounting gig.  the right half, more creative, picked up painting, and taught pottery at the local community college.  

on top of the spectacle of a man split in half, the townsfolk could not believe how rarely they saw both halves of don at the same place.  indeed, nobody could think of even one occurrence of this happening.

now one day, half a man walks into a bar.  the left half of don, always punctual, walked into the local watering hole at precisely 8:00, and ordered a shot of whisky, which the bartender poured for him.

at 8:01, the right half of don wandered in, sat down, asked for a beer, and nodded to his other half, which nodded back.  as the bartender poured him the beer, the left half of don took his shot, left just enough to cover the bill, and left at precisely 8:02.

the bartender was astounded-- he was the first person to see the two halves interact since the accident.  as it dawned on him how rare this was, the bartender exclaimed, a little louder than he wanted to, ""whole don here for just one minute!""

''simply put in a sample of your urine and the computer will diagnose your problem and tell you what you can do about it. it only costs $10."" bill figured he had nothing to lose, so he filled a jar with a urine sample and went to the drug store. finding the computer, he poured in the sample and deposited the $10. the computer started making some noise and various lights started flashing. after a brief pause out popped a small slip of paper on which was printed: ""you have tennis elbow. soak your arm in warm water. avoid heavy lifting. it will be better in two weeks.""

later that evening while thinking how amazing this new technology was and how it would change medical science forever, he began to wonder if this machine could be fooled. he mixed together some tap water, a stool sample from his dog and urine samples from his wife and daughter. to top it off, he masturbated into the concoction. he went back to the drug store, located the machine, poured in the sample and deposited the $10. the computer again made the usual noise and printed out the following message:

""your tap water is too hard. get a water softener. your dog has worms. get him vitamins. your daughter is using cocaine. put her in a rehabilitation clinic. your wife is pregnant with twin girls. they aren't yours. get a lawyer. and if you don't stop jerking off, your tennis elbow will never get better.""",2,48,1,1555388749.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/bdpoo6/one_daybill_complained_to_his_friend_that_his/

116701,Why their are Angels on top of the Xmas Tree,"have you ever wondered how the tradition of putting an angel on the tree started? it may not be as magical as you might think, 

when four of santa's elves got sick, the trainee elves did not produce toys as fast as the regular ones, and santa began to feel the pre-christmas pressure.

then mrs. claus told santa that her mother was coming to visit, which stressed santa even more.
when he went to harness the reindeer, he found that three of them were about to give birth and two others had jumped the fence and were out, heaven knows where.

then when he began to load the sleigh, one of the floorboards cracked, the toy bag fell to the ground and all the toys were scattered.

frustrated, santa went in the house for a cup of apple cider and a shot of rum. when he went to the cupboard, he discovered the elves had drunk all the cider and hidden the liquor.

in his frustration, he accidentally dropped the cider jug, and it broke into hundreds of little glass pieces all over the kitchen floor.

he went to get the broom and found the mice had eaten all the straw off the end of the broom.
just then the doorbell rang, and an irritated santa marched to the door, yanked it open, and there stood a little angel with a great big christmas tree.

the angel said very cheerfully, ""merry christmas, santa. isn't this a lovely day? i have a beautiful tree for you. where would you like me to stick it?""

and thus began the tradition of the little angel on top of the christmas tree.

it was a doctor notifying him that his wife had just been in an accident and was in critical condition and in icu.
the man told the doctor to inform his wife where he was and that he'd be there as soon as possible.

as he hung up he realized he was leaving what was shaping up to be his best ever round of golf. he decided to get in a couple of more holes before heading to the hospital.

he ended up playing all eighteen, finishing his round shooting a personal best 61, shattering the club record by five strokes and beating his previous best game by more than 10. he was jubilant.  then he remembered his wife.

feeling guilty he dashed to the hospital.  he saw the doctor in the corridor and asked about his wife's condition.

the doctor glared at him and shouted, “you went ahead and finished your round of golf didn't you!"" ""i hope you're proud of yourself!""  ""while you were out for the past four hours enjoying yourself at the country club your wife has been languishing in the icu!""

“it's just as well you went ahead and finished that round because it will be more than likely be your last! for the rest of her life she will require round the clock care and you will be her care giver!

she will need iv's; you will have to change her colostomy bag every 3 hours; she will have to be spoon fed 3 times a day and don't forget the hygiene care.""

5332,"Once upon a time, there were three kingdoms...","once upon a time, there were three kingdoms, all bordering on the same lake. for centuries, these kingdoms had fought over an island in the middle of that lake. one day, they decided to have it out, once and for all. 

the first kingdom was quite rich, and sent an army of 25 knights, each with three squires. the night before the battle, the knights jousted and cavorted as their squires polished armor, cooked food, and sharpened weapons. the second kingdom was not so wealthy, and sent only 10 knights, each with 2 squires. the night before the battle, the knights cavorted and sharpened their weapons as the squires polished armor and prepared dinner. the third kingdom was very poor, and only sent one elderly knight with his sole squire. the night before the battle, the knight sharpened his weapon, while the squire, using a looped rope, slung a pot high over the fire to cook while he prepared the knight's armor. 

the next day, the battle began. all the knights of the first two kingdoms had cavorted a bit too much (one should never cavort while sharpening weapons and jousting) and could not fight. the squire of the third kingdom could not rouse the elderly knight in time for combat. so, in the absence of the knights, the squires fought. 

the battle raged well into the late hours, but when the dust finally settled, a solitary figure limped from the carnage. the lone squire from the third kingdom dragged himself away, beaten, bloodied, but victorious. 

and it just goes to prove, the squire of the high pot and noose is equal to the sum of the squires of the other two sides.﻿

they had a great time, hitting bar after bar, knocking back drinks, but being so genetically different, the alcohol affected them each in different ways: the lemon got very acidic and refluxy; the potato, being a big starchy chap, took the booze in his stride; while the little pea reacted to all the sugar and started to get a touch hyperactive.

at the end of the night, the three friends found themselves leaving a bar at the top of a tall hill, when all of a sudden the pea started bouncing up and down excitedly: ""lads! lads! i've got a great idea! we’re all vaguely round in shape, let's not get a cab home, let's just roll down the hill!"" and before the others could protest he was off - shooting down the hill at a rate of knots.

the lemon lurched after him, but soon started listing violently from side to side as he went, owing to his oval shape, which did nothing for his unsettled stomach. with a sigh, the potato trundled along slowly behind.

by the time the potato had bounced his way to the bottom of the hill, the lemon was spewing lemon juice all over the pavement, but the pea was already jumping up and down again ""that was great, that was great, let's do it again!"". 

the lemon was now chundering up pips with the acid, but the pea didn't seem to care ""come on! let's go again, that was great!"".

the potato turned to him and said ""easy peasy, lemon's queasy.""

we clicked pretty quickly, and started chatting regularly.  every day, sometimes throughout the day.  slowly we learned more about each other.  her dog's name was daisy.  my truck's name was dodge ram (i apologized for my lack of creativity).  she was a cpa.  i was a beekeeper.

and at this, she stumbled.  ""if we ever meet in real-life, i want you to know that i could never date a beekeeper.""  but we were still far away from that point, so it was moot.

but time went on, and we gradually became closer to that point.  more personal information.  what firm she worked for.  where my farm was.  names of relatives.  names of high schools.  all the things that just come up in conversation eventually if you talk to someone long enough.

but, oddly, after all this time, neither of us had thought to send any pictures.  until one day i got a message from her: ""i never thought i'd say this, but i really do want to meet you in person.  i think we have a rare connection, and i don't want to squander it.  i want to send you my picture, and i want you to send me yours, but i'm telling you, i can never date a beekeeper.""

scientist: it became a theory that size of the subject could be a factor, so we tried apples. again infusing them with human dna, they turned out to be better than the pumpkins. they were far less barbaric, but acted like herbivore livestock, we liked to compare them to cows. they didn't really do much, they just ate grass and pooped.

journalist: were there any successful test results?

scientist: yes actually, we tried the test once more on the smallest subjects we had at our disposal, peas. infusing the peas with human dna resulted in a brilliance abundance of life. these peas were extremely intelligent, in just a matter of hours they set up a town, overnight they made a nest as enormous and complex as a typical city full of around 100,000 peas. would you care to see?

one day her little sister called and asked me to come over to check the wedding invitations. she was alone when i arrived. she whispered to me that soon i was to be married, and she had feelings and desires for me that she couldn't overcome and didn't really want to overcome. she told me that she wanted to make love to me just once before i got married and committed my life to her sister. i was in total shock and couldn't say a word. she said, ""i'm going upstairs to my bedroom, and if you want to go ahead with it just come up and get me."" i was stunned. i was frozen in shock as i watched her go up the stairs. when she reached the top she pulled down her panties and threw them down the stairs at me. i stood there for a moment, then turned and went straight to the front door. i opened the door and stepped out of the house. i walked straight towards my car. my future father-in-law was standing outside. with tears in his eyes he hugged me and said, ""we are very happy that you have passed our little test. we couldn't ask for a better man for our daughter. welcome to the family"".

107329,Sarah was in the fertilized egg business.,"she had several hundred young pullets and ten roosters to fertilize the eggs.

she kept records and any rooster not performing went into the soup pot and was replaced.

this took a lot of time, so she bought some tiny bells and attached them to her roosters. each bell had a different tone, so she could tell from a distance which rooster was performing. now, she could sit on the porch and fill out an efficiency report by just listening to the bells.

sarah's favorite rooster, old butch, was a very fine specimen but, this morning she noticed old butch's bell hadn't rung at all! when she went to investigate, she saw the other roosters were busy chasing pullets, bells-a-ringing, but the pullets hearing the roosters coming, would run for cover.

to sarah's amazement, old butch had his bell in his beak, so it couldn't ring. he'd sneak up on a pullet, do his job, and walk on to the next one. sarah was so proud of old butch, she entered him in a show and he became an overnight sensation among the judges.

the result was the judges not only awarded old butch the ""no bell peace prize"" they also awarded him the ""pulletsurprise"" as well.",2,192,5,1573577162.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/dvcjw0/sarah_was_in_the_fertilized_egg_business/

not wanting to get into any marital strife, he asked her to wait while
he went into the house to confer with mary, his wife.  they talked
much about the rightness and wrongness of it.  it was hard to make the
decision but finally his wife agreed, on one condition.

57599,The World's worst joke...,"in plymouth there was a large aquarium, it was the pride of the town and had a worldwide reputation. despite the decline in the fishing industry the tourism from the aquarium had bolstered the economy and prevented the town from slipping into the local recession that had struck many places along the same stretch of coast.  
  
there were long halls full of crabs and eels and creatures from the deep of every description. all these long halls converged to a large central tank that contained the centre piece of the entire aquarium. living within this vast tank were some of the oldest and rarest creatures housed anywhere on earth. there was a dolphin with 3 dorsel fins, a large walrus with tusks in the shape of the last 2 popes, a thin frail porpoise that was said to be 250 years old, and a giant squid that was every colour of the rainbow.  
  
it was just last year that a startling thought came to the mayor of the town. he had been on his annual tour to show his appreciation for the aquarium when it dawned on him that there was little or no security overseeing the towns aquatic asset.  
  
during a hurried conference with the directors overseeing the facility he demanded that more stringent measures be put in place to safeguard this hub of the tourist industry.  
  
the scheme was an all round winner as not only did it provide the much needed security, it also gave the directors a chance to get themselves in the papers yet again. the mayor turned the whole thing into a political publicity coup by ensuring that five local fisherman who had lost their jobs through the fishing decline all became the new security force at the aquarium.  
  
and so it was that bob, jim, geoff, bernard, and sid all regularly patrolled the empty halls of the aquarium to ensure that no intruders ever made their way in to steal, disturb or damage the livestock.  
  
a few weeks into the scheme, the tourists began to complain of small bags and wrappers on the floor and left on the edges of the tanks each day. fearing any bad publicity, the directors quickly hauled in all five security guards and asked them to be extra vigilant in ensuring no people left any litter behind. the guards said that they would do their best.  
  
the problem persisted and so the directors secretly installed security cameras in order to track down the culprits. the first morning that the tapes were viewed quickly established that it was the guards themselves that were the secret litter bugs.  
  
in a heated meeting, the directors banned all food being brought onto the premises by any staff and the guards had a weeks wages docked from their pay.  
  
sleeping through the hot summer days and going hungry through the long nights soon began to became a drag. one particularly long night all five guards met near the central tank - hungry, tired, and exhausted.  
  
""i need food,"" whimpered bob.  
""we could always eat the fish,"" suggested sidney.  
""don't be stupid,"" said geoff.  
""lets all stay calm,"" said bernard.  
""i've been thinking,"" said jim, thoughtfully.  
""haven't we all,"" responded geoff, ""there's nothing else to do round here but think. i'm all thunk out.""  
""no, look,"" continued jim. ""here we all are famished, and there's a snack machine just over there.""  
""oh, security guards vandalising the snack machine, that'll go down a treat,"" said bob, sarcastically.  
jim sighed. ""no one need ever know.""  
""and what about the camera pointing straight at it?"" asked bernard.  
""aha, but there's no camera pointing at the back of it!"" announced jim.  
sidney looked on in despair. ""do you not think that has something to do with the fact that you would have to walk across the water of the main tank in order to reach the back of it? you idiot!""  
""and what would we do with the wrappers?"" said bob nervously. ""there's talk of them searching us all soon, every morning!""
jim smiled a long cunning smile. ""as i said, i've been thinking. we can drop the wrappers into the tank itself, no one will ever see them.""  
geoff was only half convinced. ""there's still the matter of getting across the water without getting completely soaked.""  
""i've thought of that, watch this..."" jim walked over to the tank and splashed the water while listening.  
  
as the others all watched in amazement, the prize animals of the aquarium all swam to the surface and made their way over to the crowd of men. without even blinking, jim removed his shoes and socks, rolled up his trousers, and then climbed aboard the walrus with the papal tusks. a difficult journey across the tank then ensued, followed by the even more difficult task of unscrewing the back of a snacks machine whilst astride a large walrus.  
  
the pair were soon back safely across and the walrus was rewarded with a crunchie, which it seem to enjoy. the men all enjoyed a feast of snacks and fizzy drinks and slipped the rubbish into the tank to sink out of view.  
  
the next night, bob said he would perform the ride as it looked like fun. he rippled his hand in the water and all the animals swam over with a look of pining on their faces. bob chose the triple-finned dolphin and made his way to the machine. he selected a range of snacks for his colleagues and the dolphin chose a twix.  
  
the next night was more of the same with sidney opting to perform the ride and the multi-coloured giant squid choosing a snickers ice cream.  
  
the following night, bernard decided to give it a go and took the orders off all his colleagues. he was about to sit on the small frail porpoise when geoff grabbed him back.  
  
""don't sit on that ancient thing"" snapped geoff.  
""what?"" asked bernard.  
""he's right"" said jim. ""that creature is over 250 years old and very weak, if we were to kill it by riding it, that would ruin the little scheme we have going here. i say we never use this creature, the others are all strong enough anyway.""  
so bernard rode across on the walrus and everyone was happy.  
  
several months later, after a set of extraordinary circumstances, david attenborough was sitting in the offices of the aquarium directors. the directors apologised for disturbing his busy schedule and explained that they had discovered something amazing and he was the only man on earth that might be able to explain the event.
  
they explained at how concerned they had become that the level of outgoing snacks had risen sharply and yet the financial takings from the machines had dropped significantly. they had also noticed that the animals in the central tank had become increasingly tired and their appetites had dropped.  
  
they had not connected the two at all at first. however, when they reviewed the footage of the security cameras, they found that nothing out of the ordinary seemed to be happening to any of the machines. then one of the directors suddenly noticed that during the night something funny seemed to happen near the machine by the central tank. although nothing seemed to happen to the machine itself, there were signs of large ripples in the water nearby just in view at the corner of the screen. a quick check of that stock record showed that this was the machine that had lost the most stock out of them all.  
  
""and this is why we have called you in mr. attenborough, the only explanation we have is that the animals in the central tank are actually stealing snacks from the rear of the snacks machine. we even found that they have hidden the rubbish in the bottom of their tank.""  
  
david attenborough agreed that it was all very exciting and that he would love to help out in any way he could. the directors said they were planning to open up 24 hours so that people could visit at night and watch the amazing creatures perform their daring raids.  
  
mr. attenborough wasn't so sure. too much human attention straight away could frighten the animals and make them stop their nightly snack swims. he suggested that the best idea would be to set up a hidden bbc film crew to film the animals at work. it could be broadcast live across the world and so give the directors the publicity they sought. if the animals slowly got comfortable witha human presence then night opening could follow later.  
  
the directors thought this was brilliant. they also decided not to tell the security guards as the idiots would probably get a bit camera hungry and try and hog the limelight. it was thought best to just to leave the guards to wander round as normal, oblivious to the global spotlight suddenly focused on the central tank.  
  
and so it was that on the fateful night that over a billion people worldwide tuned in to stare at the grainy night vision camera shots as the world waited to witness the moment the animals would display their dazzling intelligence tricks in order to find food.  
  
the directors all sat round a tv with the champagne nearby, all ready to toast the 8th wonder of the world right here in their aquarium in plymouth.  
  
words like shock, disgust, and outrage don't nearly go far enough in describing what the directors felt when they witnessed the hulking fat form of bernard slump himself onto the rarest dolphin in existence and proceed to waggle the creature across the water before performing a blatant act of vandalism mixed with insider company theft.  
  
david attenborough was deeply disappointed and annoyed at someone of his age and standing being made to hide in the cold darkness for nothing. the world watching at home found the whole thing to be very funny, but the amusement would only last for one night and it certainly wasn't going to pull the crowds in.  
  
the very next morning, all five guards were summoned to hear of their instant dismissal and to explain/plead why the company shouldn't have them all locked up on criminal charges.  
  
the guards selected jim as their spokesman, as he was the most clever, and besides which, he'd got them all into this mess in the first place. the directors took several minutes to calm themselves down before oen of them spoke.  
  
""how? just how? how... how could you?"" he finally exploded.  
""we're all very sorry. really, we are."" jim hesitantly replied.  
""sorry? you humiliate this company in front of the entire world and you say you're sorry!""  
""yes. we cannot say how sorry we are.""  
""we hired you to keep the place nice and you just littered it!""  
""we're sorry about that.""  
""so we take away your messy snacks and you go behind our backs...""  
""we're sorry about that as well.""  
""...and, without a care, you steal from this company...""  
""and we're very sorry about that.""  
""and you selfishly drop your grubby litter into the main tank of the aquarium...""  
""ah, yes, we're sorry about that, too.""  
""...and you intentionally put the animals at risk. yes! you deliberately gambled the well being of all five of our rarest specimens, all for your own greed. we could have lost all five of our prize collection through your own very stupid and very deliberate actions!""  
""actually sir, that isn't quite true...""  
""what?""  
""we didn't do it on porpoise.""",2,3,3,1560499684.0,https://www.reddit.com/r/Jokes/comments/c0hjde/the_worlds_worst_joke/
